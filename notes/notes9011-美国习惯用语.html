    <h2>VOA美国之音</h2>

    <h4>0. blow-out</h4>
    <p>We arrived two hours late at the big <strong>blow-out</strong> for Charle’s birthday because our car had a <strong>blow-out</strong>.</p>

    <h4>1. lock, stock and barrel | hook, line and sinker</h4>
    <p>Mr. Rockefeller bought the whole oil company <strong>lock, stock and barrel</strong>.</p>
    <p>I warned Sally not to believe that man’s stories about how rich he was, but she swallowed them <strong>hook, line and sinker</strong>. After she married him, she found out he owned money to everybody in his office.</p>

    <h4>2. greasy spoon | potluck</h4>
    <p>Honey, let me take you out to dinner. But you know I don’t feel like dressing up to go someplace fancy. How about just going down the street to the <strong>greasy spoon</strong> and getting hamburgers.</p>
    <p>Mike, you ought to try the potstickers at that little Chinese joint on New York Avenue. It looks like a <strong>greasy spoon</strong> but the potstickers are great and the price is cheap.</p>
    <p>Say, Charley, if you don’t have plans for tonight, why don’t you come out to our house and take <strong>potluck</strong> with us. Helen won’t have time to cook anything special, but she can put an extra plate on the table for you.</p>
    <p>I’ve been so busy lately. Last week I went to a greasy spoon with a friend and this Sunday I’ve got to go a <strong>potluck</strong>.</p>

    <h4>3. It goes in one ear and out the other | to play by ear</h4>
    <p>I told Sally it was foolish to marry that man, but it <strong>went in one ear and out the other</strong>. Now she wishes she’d listened to me. He drinks and gambles and she wants to leave him.</p>
    <p>How many times have I told you to get to work on time. But my words just <strong>go in one ear and out the other</strong>. So I don’t have any choice but to fire you.</p>
    <p>I haven’t had a chance to prepare any notes so all I can do is start talking and <strong>play it by ear</strong>.</p>
    <p>I’m not sure if my wife wants me to go shopping with her on Sunday. If she decides to go with her sister instead, then I can play tennis with you. Let’s just <strong>play it by ear</strong>.</p>

    <h4>4. doggy bag | sunny side up | over easy</h4>
    <p>Waiter, could you please wrap up the rest of this steak for me? I’d like to take it home for my dog.</p>
    <p>We had so much food left over from dinner at the China garden last night that we took enough home in <strong>doggy bags</strong> to feed the whole family tonight.</p>
    <p>I would like to have my eggs <strong>sunny side up</strong>.</p>
    <p>Miss, I’d like two fried eggs <strong>sunny side up</strong> and the sausage on the side.</p>
    <p>Not me. I don’t like to see my eggs staring up at me with big yellow eyes. Miss, two fried eggs, <strong>over easy</strong> and not fried too hard.</p>

    <h4>5. in hot water | to throw cold water on something</h4>

    <p>I’ve been planning to go to medical school but my dad <strong>threw cold water on</strong> this idea the other day when he told me he wasn’t sure he had the money to pay my tuition for so long.</p>

    <h4>6. to hold water | water off a duck’s back | it makes my mouth water</h4>
    <p>The accused man claimed that he’d been in another city the night of the murder. But his story didn’t <strong>hold water</strong> after three different witnesses testified in court that they had seen him running from the scene of the crime.</p>
    <p>I keep telling my friend it’s foolish to gamble all his pay, but it’s like <strong>water off a duck’s back</strong>.</p>
    <p>The doctors tell us it’s dangerous to smoke, but such good advice rolls off some people like <strong>water off a duck’s back</strong>.</p>
    <p>The roast duck that restaurant serves is my favorite dish. Every time I think about it, <strong>it makes my mouth water</strong>.</p>

    <h4>7. blow up | blow out</h4>

    <h4>8. to be led by the nose | under your nose</h4>
    <p>Ed’s wife is a strong-minded woman and <strong>leads him around by the nose</strong>.</p>
    <p>Remember, Son, don’t let other people <strong>lead you around by the nose</strong>. You’ll get along a lot better in life if you use your own judgment and do what you yourself think is the right thing.</p>
    <p>See, they are right <strong>under your nose</strong> all the time.</p>
    <p>Did you read in the paper how bold that robber was at the art museum? He cut three paintings from their frames and walked out with them right <strong>under the nose</strong> of the guards.</p>

    <p><strong>Pull their socks up</strong> and get back in the game.</p>

    <p>I never know whether my boss likes my work or not – he is a real <strong>poker face</strong>.</p>
    <p>I tried to keep a <strong>poker face</strong> even though I was scared to death when I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests. But I admit I gave him the biggest smile of my life when he told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me.</p>
    <p>Two other governors have already announced that they will run for president in the next election but the governor of our state is still keeping his plans <strong>close to his vest</strong> – nobody is sure what he will do.</p>
    <p>John, keep this <strong>close to your vest</strong> but I want to tell you our company is going to merge with a big New York Corporation – they’ll announce it sometime next week.</p>

    <h4>11. the shoe is on the other foot | to work hand in glove</h4>
    <p>Back in school we made fun of Jones because we thought he spent too much time studying instead of having fun. Now <strong>the shoe is on the other foot</strong> – he’s made lots of money and the rest of us are just barely making enough to feed our families.</p>
    <p>For the last ten years the Tigers have been the worst team in the league: we’ve finished down at the bottom. But now <strong>the shoe is on the other foot</strong>: we have all these good young players and we’re beating everybody else in the whole league.</p>
    <p>The local police are <strong>working hand in glove</strong> with the FBI to find the bank robbers.<br/>
    当地的警察正在和联邦调查局密切合作设法找到那些抢劫银行的罪犯。</p>

    <p>Turn left at the next corner and then <strong>follow your nose</strong> – you can’t miss it.<br/>
    到前面的路口向左转，然后一直走就到了，你不会看不到的。</p>
    <p>You say you’re looking for the French Bakery? Just walk two blocks north, turn left, and you can smell that wonderful smell of fresh bread baking: just <strong>follow your nose</strong> and it will bring you right to the front door.<br/>
    随着香味走（利用嗅觉找到什么东西）</p>
    <p>My brother Bob borrowed the money to open his restaurant five years ago when the interest rate was so high, so he’s been <strong>paying through the nose</strong> ever since.<br/>
    我哥哥在五年前借钱开他那个饭馆的时候正好利率非常高。所以，他从那时起就一直在大笔地还债。</p>
    <p>Life is funny. When the famous Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh was alive, nobody wanted to buy his pictures. But now rich people will <strong>pay through the nose</strong> for one, sometimes more than five million dollars.</p>

    <h4>13. to keep an ear to the ground | up to one’s ears</h4>
    <p>Every two weeks while the Congress is in session, I try to get back home to California to talk to people. This doesn’t give me much time to relax with my family, but I have to <strong>keep an ear to the ground</strong> and hear what voters are thinking about.</p>
    <p>I try to <strong>keep an ear to the ground</strong> and what I hear these days is that most people think we spend too much money on building roads and not enough on our schools.</p>

    市长说他不知道他手下的工作人员接受贿赂。可是，我猜想他完全是介入这件事的。</p>

    <h4>14. sweeten the pot | the cards are stacked against you</h4>
    <p>Miss Smith didn’t want the job until the company <strong>sweetened the pot</strong> by offering her a higher salary and the use of a company car.</p>
    <p>They’ve built so many new office buildings here that they have trouble renting out all the space. So some landlords <strong>sweeten the pot</strong>; they offer a company six months free rent if it signs a three-year lease.</p>
    <p>Last night I got into a poker game with these men I met in the hotel bar. And I lost a thousand dollars before I realized <strong>the cards were stacked against me</strong>. All I could do was pick up the money I had left and walk away.</p>
    <p>I really wanted to try out for the basketball team when I was in college. But <strong>the cards were stacked against me</strong>: I’m only five feet six inches tall and everybody else was six-two or even taller.</p>

    <h4>15. to fly off the handle | to bark up the wrong tree</h4>
    <p>My wife spent all afternoon yesterday cooking a special dinner for our wedding anniversary. So she really <strong>flew off the handle</strong> when I came home three hours late.</p>
    <p>Honey, please don’t <strong>fly off the handle</strong> – I had a little accident with the car, but it certainly wasn’t my fault.</p>
    <p>If my brother-in-law hopes to borrow any more money from me, he will be <strong>barking up the wrong tree</strong>.</p>
    <p>Hey man, if you think I was the guy who rubbed that bank today, you’re <strong>barking up the wrong tree</strong>! I was nowhere near the place.</p>

    <h4>16. right on the beam | to fly by the seat of his pants</h4>
    <p>Your school report is <strong>right on the beam</strong>: you followed the direction exactly and got all the facts down in the right order.</p>
    <p>I though Mr. Claghorn’s speech is <strong>right on the beam</strong> last night! Just like what he says, we need to spend more money on educating our children. He makes a lot of sense to me.</p>
    <p>When Jones started up business in a new town, he didn’t know anybody, so he had to <strong>fly by the seat of his pants</strong>.</p>
    <p>Driving to a friend’s house last night I took the wrong turn off the main highway and got lost. I didn’t have a road map but I <strong>flew by the seat of my pants</strong> and after twenty minutes I found the street I was looking for.</p>

    <h4>17. to keep one’s shirt on | to lose one’s shirt</h4>
    <p><strong>Keep your shirt on</strong>, Harry; we have plenty of time to catch the train.</p>
    <p>Honey, <strong>keep your shirt on</strong>, please! I’m sorry, but the boss made me work late at the office.</p>
    <p>Did you hear what happened to Joe? He’s <strong>lost his shirt</strong>, the poor guy – invested all his money in a fancy restaurant and it just went out of business.</p>
    <p>Be careful of salesmen who call on the phone and offer to sell you land on the beach down in Florida. You can <strong>lose your shirt</strong> because the chances are the land is under the water at high tide.</p>

    <h4>18. a stuffed shirt | to give you the shirt off his back</h4>
    <p>My boss is a <strong>stuffed shirt</strong>: all he talks about is how important his ancestors are, how he was number one in his class at his university, and the wonderful things he thinks he’s done for your company.</p>
    <p>I think I’ll vote for Jimmy Brown instead of the other guy James Leland Elegant the third. Jimmy isn’t a <strong>stuffed shirt</strong> like Elegant – he’s a friendly, informal guy like us ordinary people.</p>
    <p>Of course Dad gets mad at me sometimes for no good reason. But if I ever need it, I know he would <strong>give me the shirt off his back</strong>.</p>
    <p>Pete never says very much. But when he hears about somebody who’s sick in the hospital or lost his job, he’s always the first to put his hand in his pocket and bring out money to help. Yes, sir, he’s the kind of man who’d <strong>give you the shirt off his back</strong>.</p>

    <h4>19. to bail out | nose dive</h4>
    <p>Smith was lucky enough <strong>to bail out</strong> and quit the company just before it went bankrupt.</p>
    <p>After his restaurant failed, Bill couldn’t pay back the money he had borrowed from the bank. He was afraid the bank would take the house he’d put up as security. But his dad <strong>bailed him out</strong> and paid the loan off for him.</p>
    <p>Today the stock market took a <strong>nose dive</strong> and dropped 25 points.</p>
    <p>Everybody thought this young actor would have a brilliant future after he starred in two pictures that made a lot of money. The he appeared in three films that nobody want to see, and his career took a <strong>nose dive</strong> – no producer wants him anymore.</p>

    <h4>20. up in arms | at arm’s length</h4>
    <p>All us students are <strong>up in arms</strong> at the news the school is raising our tuition ten percent.<br/>
    当我们学生听到学校要提高百分之十的学费时，我们都火冒三丈。</p>
    <p>No way am I going to vote for a bill to raise income tax again. The voters back home are already <strong>up in arms</strong> about how much he government takes out of their pay already and I have to run for re-election this fall.</p>
    <p>I keep trying to get friendly with that lovely blonde who sits next to me in biology class. But she keeps me <strong>at arm’s length</strong>.（和某人保持一定距离）</p>
    <p>Let me warn you about this Smith fellow. He seems like a nice, friendly guy. But it’s like wise to <strong>keep him at arm’s length</strong>. You get too friendly with him, and the first thing he’ll do is ask to borrow money from you.</p>

    <h4>21. to shake a leg | to pull one’s leg</h4>
    <p>Come on, <strong>shake a leg</strong>, son, or you’re going to be late for school.</p>
    <p>Let’s <strong>shake a leg</strong> there, you guys! I got to get this truck unloaded and on the way back to the warehouse before dark.</p>
    <p>My roommate said this girl had told him she wouldn’t mind going out with me. But when I invited her to a movie, I learned he was just <strong>pulling my leg</strong>. <br/>（开某人玩笑）</p>
    <p>Hey, stop <strong>pulling my leg</strong>, will you! I don’t believe that girl really said she likes me and would like me to take her out.</p>
    <p>Break a leg! <br/>祝愿成功！</p>

    <h4>22. to twist someone’s arm | to charge someone an arm and a leg</h4>
    <p>I didn’t want to see that movie about Mozart, but my roommate <strong>twisted my arm</strong>. I’m glad he did – it was a great show.<br/>（给某人施加压力，迫使他做你要他做的事）</p>
    <p>My son has been <strong>twisting my arm</strong> to let him take my car out on a date ever since he got his driver’s license. This weekend, I finally let him take it. And now it’s in the body shop for a thousand dollars of repairs: he had an accident on the way to pick up his girlfriend.</p>
    <p>Don’t go to that fancy new restaurant. The food isn’t very good and they <strong>charge you an arm and a leg</strong> for it!</p>
    <p>Say, if you need a dentist, you might want to try my brother. He’s fresh out of dental school and trying to set up a practice. But he does good work, and he won’t <strong>charge you an arm and a leg</strong> for it like most other dentists.</p>

    <h4>23. to take candy from a baby | a piece of cake</h4>
    <p>Getting grandmother to loan me the money was as easy as <strong>taking candy from a baby</strong>.</p>
    <p>Lousy told us that robbing this bank would be as easy as <strong>taking candy from a baby</strong>. But somebody told the police and they were waiting for us. We had no choice but to throw down our guns and surrender.</p>

    <h4>24. top gun | bottom line</h4>
    <p>Read this book by professor Winter – he’s a <strong>top gun</strong> in Shakespeare research.</p>
    <p>Sorry, I don’t handle divorces myself, but if you really want to divorce your husband, I can give you the name of two of the <strong>top guns</strong> in New York when it comes to getting a good divorce settlement.</p>
