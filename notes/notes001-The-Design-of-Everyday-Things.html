            Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit out needs so well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the other hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable.

            One prupose of this book is to give back of your control over the products in your life: to know how to select usable and understandable ones, to know how to fix those that aren't so usable or understandable.

            To understand products, it is not enough to understand desing or technology: it is critical to understand <strong>business</strong>.

            Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding:<br>
            <strong>Discoverability</strong>: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?<br>
            <strong>Understanding</strong>: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?<br>
