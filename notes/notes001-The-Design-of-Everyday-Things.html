            Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit out needs so well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the other hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable.

            One prupose of this book is to give back of your control over the products in your life: to know how to select usable and understandable ones, to know how to fix those that aren't so usable or understandable.

            To understand products, it is not enough to understand desing or technology: it is critical to understand <strong>business</strong>.

            Two of the most important characteristics of good design:<br>
            <strong>Discoverability</strong>: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?<br>
            <strong>Understanding</strong>: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The major areas of design relevant to this book are:<br>
            <strong>Industrial design</strong>: The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer (from the <a href="http://www.idsa.org/" target="_blank">Industrial Design Society of America</a>'s website).<br>
            <strong>Interaction design</strong>: The focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance people's understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction design draws upon principles of psychology, design, art and emotion to ensure a postive, enjoyable experience.<br>
            <strong>Experience design</strong>: The practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and enviroments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            Engineers are designing for people the way they would like them to be, not for the way they really are. Even experts make errors, so we mush design our machines on the assumption that people will make errors.
        </p>

        <h4>Human-Centered Design</h4>
        <p>
            Good design requires good communication, especially from machine to person, indicating what actions are possible, what is happening, and what is about to happen. Designers need to focus their attention on the cases where things go wrong, not just on when things work as planned.
        </p>

        <h4>Fundamental Principles of Interaction</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Affordances</strong>: a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used.<br>
            <strong>Signifiers</strong>: affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. Once I interpret a falg's motion to indicate wind direction, it does not matter why it was placed there.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Affordances represent the possibilities in the world for how an agent (a person, animal, or machine) can interact with something. Some affordances are perceivable, others are invisible.<br>
            Signifiers are signals. Some signifiers are signs, labels, and drawings placed in the world, such as the signs labeled "push", "pull", or "exit" on doors, or arrows and diagrams indicating what is to be acted upon or in which direction to gesture, or other instructions.
