<h3 id="1-a-flight-youd-never-forget">1 A Flight You'd Never Forget</h3>
<p>THE FLIGHT LASTED just a few minutes, but so many of the details are rich and vivid to me.</p>
<p>The wind was coming from the north not the south, which was unusual for that time of year. And my wheels made a distinct rumbling sound as they rolled across the rural Texas airstrip. I remember the smell of the warm engine oil, and how it drifted into the cockpit as I prepared to take off. There was also the smell of freshly cut grass in the air.</p>
<p>I have a clear recollection of how my body felt—this heightened sense of alertness—as I taxied to the end of the runway, went through my checklist, and got ready to go. And I recall the moment the plane lifted into the air and, just three minutes later, how I would need to return to the runway, intensely focused on the tasks at hand.</p>
<p>All these memories are with me still.</p>
<p>A pilot can take off and land thousands of times in his life, and so much of it feels like a speeding blur. But almost always, there is a particular flight that challenges a pilot or teaches or changes him, and every sensory moment of that experience remains in his head forever.</p>
<p>I have had a few unforgettable flights in my life, and they continue to live in my mind, conjuring up a host of emotions and reasons for reflection. One took me to New York's Hudson River on a cold January day in 2009. But before that, perhaps the most vivid was the one I've just described: my first solo flight, late on a Saturday afternoon at a grass airstrip in Sherman, Texas. It was June 3, 1967, and I was sixteen years old.</p>
<p>I hold on to this one, and a handful of others, as I look back on all the forces that molded me as a boy, as a man, and as a pilot. Both in the air and on the ground, I was shaped by many powerful lessons and experiences—and many people. I am grateful for all of them. It's as if these moments from my life were deposited in a bank until I needed them. As I worked to safely land Flight 1549 in the Hudson, almost subconsciously, I drew on those experiences.</p>
<p>FOR A few months when I was four years old, I wanted to be a policeman and then a fireman. By the time I was five, however, I knew exactly what I wanted to do with my life—and that was to fly.</p>
<p>I never wavered once this possibility came into my head. Or more precisely, came over my head, in the form of jet fighters that crisscrossed the sky above my childhood home outside Denison, Texas.</p>
<p>We lived by a lake on a sparse stretch of land nine miles north of Perrin Air Force Base. Because it was such a rural area, the jets flew pretty low, at about three thousand feet, and you could always hear them coming. My dad would give me his binoculars, and I loved looking into the distance, to the horizon, wondering what was out there. It fed my wanderlust. And in the case of the jets, what was out there was even more exciting because it was coming closer and closer at a very high rate of speed.</p>
<p>This was the 1950s, and those machines were a lot louder than today's fighters. Still, I never came across people in my part of North Texas who minded the noise. We had won World War II not long before, and the Air Force was a source of pride. It wasn't until decades later, when residents near air bases began talking about the noise, that pilots felt the need to answer the complaints. They'd sport bumper stickers that said JET NOISE: THE SOUND OF FREEDOM.</p>
<p>Every aspect of airplanes was fascinating—the different sounds they made, the way they looked, the physics that allowed them to rocket through the sky, and most of all, the men who controlled them with obvious mastery.</p>
<p>I built my first model airplane when I was six years old. It was a replica of Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis. I read a lot about “Lucky Lindy” and understood that his flight across the Atlantic wasn't really about luck. He planned. He prepared. He endured. That's what made him heroic to me.</p>
<p>By 1962, when I was eleven years old, I was already reading every book and magazine I could find that talked about flying. That was also the year I took my first plane ride. My mom, a first-grade teacher, invited me to accompany her to a statewide PTA convention in Austin, and it was her first plane ride, too.</p>
<p>The airport, Dallas Love Field, was seventy-five miles south of our house, and when we got there, it seemed like a magical place filled with larger-than-life people. Pilots. Stewardesses. Well-dressed passengers with somewhere to go.</p>
<p>In the terminal, I stopped at the newly installed statue of a Texas Ranger. The plaque read ONE RIOT, ONE RANGER, and told the apocryphal story of a small-town disturbance in the 1890s. A local sheriff had called for a company of rangers to stop the violence, and when only one ranger showed up, the townspeople were taken aback. They'd asked for help and now wondered if they were being denied. “How many riots do you have?” the ranger allegedly asked. “If y'all got just one, all you need is one ranger. I'll take care of it.”</p>
<p>I also saw another hero that day at the airport. I had been enthralled by the early Project Mercury space missions, so I was excited to spot a short, thin man walking through the terminal. He was wearing a suit, a tie, a hat, and his face was completely familiar to me. I recognized him from television as Lieutenant Colonel John “Shorty” Powers, the voice of Mercury Control. I couldn't bring myself to approach him, though. A guy who had all these astronauts to talk to didn't need an eleven-year-old kid tugging at his jacket.</p>
<p>It was a cloudy day, a little rainy, and we walked out on the tarmac to climb a staircase onto our Braniff Airways flight, a Convair 440. My mom wore white gloves and a hat. I was in a sport coat and slacks. That's how people traveled then. In their Sunday best.</p>
<p>Our seats were on the right side of the aircraft. My mom would have loved to look out the window, but she knew me. “You take the window seat,” she said, and even before the plane had moved an inch, my face was pressed against the glass, taking everything in.</p>
<p>As the plane sped down the runway and began to rise, I was wide-eyed. My first thought was that everything on the ground looked like a model railroad layout. My second thought was that I wanted this life in the air.</p>
<p>It took a few more years for me to return to the skies. When I was sixteen, I asked my dad if I could take flying lessons. He'd been a dental surgeon in the Navy during World War II. He had great respect for aviators, and he clearly saw my passion. Through a friend, he got the name of a crop-dusting pilot named L. T. Cook Jr., who had a landing strip on his property nearby.</p>
<p>Before World War II, Mr. Cook had been an instructor in the federal government's Civilian Pilot Training Program. At the time, isolationists didn't want the United States getting involved in the war in Europe. But President Roosevelt knew the United States was likely to enter the conflict and would need thousands of qualified pilots. Starting in 1939, veteran fliers such as Mr. Cook were charged with training civilians so they'd be ready when and if war was declared. The program was controversial at the time, but as things turned out, all of those prepared pilots helped the Allies win the war. Mr. Cook and pilot trainers like him were the unsung stateside heroes.</p>
<p>When I met him, he was in his late fifties, and a no-nonsense, all-business kind of man. Most of his time was spent crop dusting, but if he saw someone who seemed to have the smarts and temperament to fly, he'd take him on as a student.</p>
<p>I guess he liked the look of me well enough. I was this tall, quiet, earnest kid, and I was respectful because my parents had taught me to be deferential to my elders. I was also the classic introvert, and he wasn't a guy who needed much conversation. He saw I was serious about flying and that I had an obvious enthusiasm, despite my low-key demeanor. He said he'd charge me six dollars per hour for the airplane. That was the “wet rate” because it included fuel. For his time training me, he asked for another three dollars an hour. My parents paid for the airplane, so for a thirty-minute flight I owed him just $1.50 for his instructor's fee. I paid for my share from money I earned in my job as a church janitor.</p>
<p>I have logbooks going back decades, covering thousands of flights. And in my first logbook, my very first entry was April 3, 1967, when Mr. Cook took me up for thirty minutes. We flew in a tandem two-seater, an Aeronca 7DC. It was a very basic propeller airplane, built in the late 1940s. It didn't even have a radio. I had the controls in my hands from pretty much the first moment.</p>
<p>I sat in front, Mr. Cook sat in back with his own set of controls, and he did what pilots call “following you through.” That meant he'd keep his hands hovering over his stick so he could instantly take command if I went astray with my stick. He shadowed my movements, shouting directions over the noise of the engine. As so many pilots did in the early years, he used a cardboard megaphone to aim the sound of his voice right in my ear. He spoke only when he needed to, and he rarely gave a compliment. Still, in the weeks that followed, I sensed that he thought I was catching on, and had the right instincts. I studied flying at home every night, too, taking a correspondence course that prepared me for the private pilot license written exam. Mr. Cook saw I was devoted.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'd arrive for a lesson and he wouldn't be there. So I'd drive into town because I knew exactly where to find him: drinking coffee at the local Dairy Queen. He'd finish his coffee, toss a tip on the table, and we'd go back to his strip.</p>
<p>He gave me sixteen lessons over the next couple of months, each averaging thirty minutes in the air. By June 3, my total flying time added up to seven hours and twenty-five minutes. That day, he took me up for a flight, and after ten minutes of flying around, he tapped me on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; he said. &quot;Bring it in for a landing and taxi over to the hangar.&quot; I did as I was told, and when we got there, he hopped out of the plane. &quot;OK,&quot; he said. &quot;Take it up and land three times by yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>He didn't wish me luck. That wasn't his way. I'm not saying he was gruff or unfeeling. It's just that he was very matter-of-fact about things. He had obviously decided: The kid's ready. Let him go. He expected I wouldn't fall out of the sky. I'd be OK.</p>
<p>These days, a boy couldn't get into the air alone so quickly. Airplanes are more complex. There are all sorts of requirements and insurance issues that have to be taken care of before someone flies solo. The air traffic control system is more complicated. And instructors may be more protective, worried and wary, too.</p>
<p>But that day, in the North Texas countryside, I didn't have to deal with air traffic control or complicated regulations. It was just me and the plane, and Mr. Cook, who was watching me from the ground.</p>
<p>Because the wind was coming from the north, I had to go to the opposite end of the runway so I could take off in that direction. That wasn't the usual direction, but I got my bearings and prepared to go.</p>
<p>The strip was lower at the south end and sloped uphill toward the north. And even though Mr. Cook had just mowed his grass strip, it wasn't as smooth as a paved runway or a putting green.</p>
<p>Alone at the end of an airstrip for the first time in my life, I checked the ignition and the oil pressure. I made sure the engine, rudder, elevator, and ailerons were working properly. I went through everything on my checklist. And as my hand tightened on the control stick, I took a breath, released the brakes, and began my takeoff. Mr. Cook had told me that I'd be leaving the ground more quickly than I was used to. The reason? The plane was now lighter with him not in it.</p>
<p>When this type of airplane heads down a runway and is ready to fly, it just lifts off. But when a new pilot is ready to fly alone, someone has to say so. That someone was the laconic Mr. Cook, nodding there on the sidelines as I rose into the air while he grew smaller and smaller in the field below me. I was grateful to him.</p>
<p>Climbing to eight hundred feet above the ground, and then circling the field, I felt an exhilarating freedom. I also felt a certain mastery. After listening, watching, asking questions, and studying hard, I had achieved something. Here I was, alone in the air.</p>
<p>I don't think I was smiling about my good fortune. I was too busy concentrating to allow myself to smile. And I knew Mr. Cook was watching me from under his baseball cap, his head tilted upward. I wanted to look good for him, to do everything right. I didn't want him to have a long list of things to critique me about when I landed.</p>
<p>As I flew, it was as if I could hear his voice. Use the rudder to keep the controls coordinated. Even though he wasn't there in the airplane, his words were still with me.</p>
<p>I was too busy to do any sightseeing. I flew over a little pond, and the town of Sherman was off to my left. But my goal was not to enjoy the view. My goal was to do this well enough so that Mr. Cook would let me do it again.</p>
<p>He had instructed me to make the usual rectangular pattern around the landing strip, which took about three minutes in flight, so I could practice touching the runway, lifting back into the air, and then coming back around to do it again. I had to do this three times before coming in for a final landing.</p>
<p>My entire first solo experience was only nine minutes or so, but I knew it was a crucial first step. I'd done my reading: In 1903, Orville Wright's first flight had traveled a distance of forty yards, had risen twenty feet in the air, and had lasted just twelve seconds.</p>
<p>Mr. Cook greeted me when it was all over, and as I shut down the engine, he said I'd done what he'd asked. There was no &quot;atta boy,&quot; but I knew I'd passed the test. He told me he'd be busy crop dusting in his other plane much of the summer, and so I might as well just keep taking his Aeronca up to practice on my own. We agreed that I could return every few days to hone my skills, alone in the sky, for six dollars per hour.</p>
<p>Now, at age fifty-eight, I have 19,700 hours of flying time under my belt. But I can trace my professional experience back to that afternoon. It was a turning point. Though I had less than eight hours in the air, Mr. Cook had given me confidence. He had given me permission to discover that I could get a plane safely into the air and then safely back to the ground. That first solo flight served as confirmation that this would be my livelihood, and my life.</p>
<p>I didn't completely focus on it at the time, but I realize now that my entrance into the world of piloting was very traditional. This is how people had learned to fly since the beginning: an older, veteran pilot teaching the basics to a youngster from a grass strip under an open sky.</p>
<p>I look back and appreciate very much that I was a lucky young man. It was a wonderful start.</p>
<p>NO ONE else in my high school was interested in being a pilot, so I was alone in my pursuit. I had friends, but a lot of the other kids saw me as this shy, studious, serious boy always reading flight manuals and heading out to the airstrip. I was not easily outgoing. I was more comfortable in a cockpit.</p>
<p>In some ways, I grew up fast on that airstrip, learning things that helped me see the possibilities in life, and the great risks.</p>
<p>One day, when I got out to Mr. Cook's hangar, I noticed a Piper Tri-Pacer, painted white with red trim, crumpled on the field at the north end of the runway. Mr. Cook told me the story. A friend of his was bringing the Tri-Pacer in for a landing, approaching the airstrip, and he had to cross over U.S. 82. He didn't realize until it was too late that there were twenty-foot-high power lines stretched along the highway. He pulled up the nose of the plane to clear the wires, but that action caused him to slow down and lose lift. His plane slammed down nose-first into the ground, and he died instantly.</p>
<p>No one had come yet to collect the wrecked plane, and so there it still sat at the end of the airstrip. I walked a quarter mile up to it and looked inside at the blood-splattered cockpit. In those days, airplanes had only lap belts, not shoulder harnesses, and I figured that his head must have hit the instrument panel with great violence. I tried to visualize how it all might have happened—his effort to avoid the power lines, his loss of speed, the awful impact. I forced myself to look in the cockpit, to study it. It would have been easier to look away, but I didn't.</p>
<p>It was a pretty sobering moment for a sixteen-year-old, and it made quite an impression on me. I realized that flying a plane meant not making mistakes. You had to maintain control of everything. You had to look out for the wires, the birds, the trees, the fog, while monitoring everything in the cockpit. You had to be vigilant and alert. It was equally important to know what was possible and what was not. One simple mistake could mean death.</p>
<p>I processed all this, but that sad scene didn't give me pause. I vowed to learn all there was to know to minimize the risks.</p>
<p>I knew I never wanted to be a hot dog—that could get me killed—but I did make my own fun. I'd tell my parents and younger sister to step outside our home at an appointed time, and then I'd fly over and waggle the wings up and down to say hello to them. We lived in such a sparsely populated area that regulations allowed me to fly as low as five hundred feet above the house. My family couldn't exactly see my face, but they could see me waving at them.</p>
<p>By October 1968, after seventy hours in the air, I was ready to try for a private pilot certificate, which required a &quot;check ride&quot; with an FAA examiner. I passed, which allowed me to fly with a passenger.</p>
<p>I thought the honor of first passenger ought to go to my mother, and my logbook shows I took her for a ride on October 29, 1968, the day after I got my certificate. I put a simple little star next to the flight data in the logbook; a small acknowledgment of a special moment. It was the 1960s equivalent of an e-mailed smiley face.</p>
<p>My mom didn't seem nervous that day, just proud. As I helped her into the back seat and strapped her in, I described the sounds she would hear, what we'd see, how her stomach might feel. The upside of my being so serious, I guess, is that I struck people as responsible and able. I wasn't a flouter of rules. And so my mom had confidence in me. She just sat back, her life in my hands, with no urge to be a back-seat driver. She let me chauffeur her around in the sky, and when we landed, she hugged me.</p>
<p>The possibility of having passengers opened up a new world, and after I took my sister, my dad, and my grandparents for a ride, I found the courage to ask someone else. Her name was Carole, and she was a cute, slender girl with brown hair and glasses. We went to Denison High together, and we were also in our church choir. I had a crush on her, and I liked to think she had noticed me, too. There are girls who are good-looking and know it, and have the luxury of getting by on their beauty. Carole was attractive, yet she didn't carry herself like those girls. Even though she wasn't overtly outgoing, she had an open, friendly manner that just drew people in.</p>
<p>No girl had ever expressed much interest in my experiences as a pilot. This was long before the movie Top Gun, and in any case, I wasn't Tom Cruise. Besides, flying was an abstract thing. No one saw me doing it. It's not like I caught winning touchdown passes and had my picture in the local paper. Everything I did was out of view and high in the sky. If I mentioned flying to girls, they never seemed hugely impressed. It sometimes felt like they were bored with the conversation. Or maybe I wasn't able to find the right words to convey the majesty of it.</p>
<p>In any case, I decided to see if I could interest Carole. She was quiet—similar to me in that way—and so it was often difficult keeping conversations going with her. When I asked her if she'd like to go flying with me, I had no expectations. Even if she wanted to go, I figured her parents wouldn't allow it. But she asked them, and they agreed to let her go on a forty-five-minute trip across the Arkansas and Poteau rivers to Fort Smith, Arkansas.</p>
<p>This was my effort at a date, and I was pretty thrilled that it was going to happen. Looking back, it's remarkable that her mom and dad said yes. In essence, they were allowing a boy, not yet eighteen years old, to take their underage daughter across state lines. In a light airplane, no less.</p>
<p>And so we went. It was a clear, cold day with smooth air and good visibility. You could see for miles in any direction. Airplanes are noisy, so it's hard to converse. I'd yell, &quot;That's the Red River down there,&quot; and she'd yell back, &quot;What?&quot; and I'd repeat myself. But I was so happy to have her aboard.</p>
<p>We flew in a Cessna 150 I'd rented for two hours. This was a very small airplane, with room only for two people, sitting side by side. The whole cabin was just three feet wide, and so my right leg was touching her left leg. There was no other way to do it.</p>
<p>Picture me, seventeen years old, with this pretty girl next to me, her leg touching mine for two hours, my arm rubbing against her arm. I could smell her perfume, or maybe it was her shampoo. Once in a while she'd lean over me to look at the sights out my window, her hair brushing against my arm. It was a new experience for me, realizing that flying could be such a sensual experience.</p>
<p>Was it hard for me to concentrate on the controls? No. I guess that was just another example of how a pilot has to learn to compartmentalize. I was completely aware of Carole, but I was also on task and responsible. I wanted to woo her, but my most important job was to keep her safe.</p>
<p>Not much came of our relationship, but that flight—sitting so close to her, shouting out landmarks of the Texas countryside, taking her to lunch at the Fort Smith airport—well, it's just a sweet, warm memory.</p>
<p>A pilot can have thousands of takeoffs and landings, most of them unremarkable. Certain ones, though, he never forgets.</p>
<p>THE LAST time I was out at L. T. Cook's airstrip was in the late 1970s. I had lost touch with him in the early eighties, and I later learned he had cancer, and had several tumors removed from his neck and jaw. Some people speculated that his illness was a result of all the crop-dusting chemicals he sprayed every day. He died in 2001.</p>
<p>After my emergency landing of US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River, I got thousands of e-mails and letters from people expressing gratitude for what my crew and I did to save all 155 people on board. In one stack of mail, I was thrilled to discover a note from Mr. Cook's widow, whom I hadn't heard from in years. Her words lifted my spirits. &quot;L.T. wouldn't be surprised,&quot; she wrote, &quot;but he certainly would be pleased and proud.&quot;</p>
<p>In many ways, all my mentors, heroes, and loved ones—those who taught me and encouraged me and saw the possibilities in me—were with me in the cockpit of Flight 1549. We had lost both engines. It was a dire situation, but there were lessons people had instilled in me that served me well. Mr. Cook's lessons were a part of what guided me on that five-minute flight. He was the consummate stick-and-rudder man, and that day over New York was certainly a stick-and-rudder day.</p>
<p>I've done a lot of thinking since then about all the special people who mattered to me, about the hundreds of books on flying that I've studied, about the tragedies I've witnessed again and again as a military pilot, about the adventures and setbacks in my airline career, about the romance of flying, and about the long-ago memories.</p>
<p>I've come to realize that my journey to the Hudson River didn't begin at LaGuardia Airport. It began decades before, in my childhood home, on Mr. Cook's grass airfield, in the skies over North Texas, in the California home I now share with my wife, Lorrie, and our two daughters, and on all the jets I've flown toward the horizon.</p>
<p>Flight 1549 wasn't just a five-minute journey. My entire life led me safely to that river.</p>
<h3 id="2-a-pilots-life">2 A Pilot's Life</h3>
<p>I WAS LUCKY enough to discover my passion for flying when I was very young, and to indulge that passion day after day. Lucky that some things went my way; my eyesight, for instance, was good enough to allow me to become a fighter pilot. And lucky that when I left the military, I found work as an airline pilot, when such jobs weren't plentiful.</p>
<p>I still feel fortunate, after all these years, to be able to follow my passion. The airline industry has its problems, and a lot of the issues can be troubling and wearying, but I still find purpose and satisfaction in flying.</p>
<p>There's a literal freedom you feel when you're at the controls, gliding above the surface of the earth, no longer bound by gravity. It's as if you're rising above the nitty-gritty details of life. Even at a few thousand feet, you get a wider perspective. Problems that loom large down below feel smaller from that height, and smaller still by the time you reach thirty-five thousand feet.</p>
<p>I love that flying is an intellectual challenge, and that there's mental math that needs to be done all along the way. If you change the angle of the nose versus the horizon by even one degree while traveling at a typical commercial airliner speed of seven nautical miles a minute, it's enough to increase or decrease your rate of climb or descent by seven hundred feet per minute. I enjoy keeping track of all the calculations, staying aware of the weather conditions, working with a team—flight attendants, air traffic controllers, first officers, maintenance crews—while knowing intimately what the plane can and cannot do. Even when the controls are being manipulated through automation, pilots have to back up the computer systems with their own mental math. I like the challenge of that.</p>
<p>I also like sharing my passion for flying. It's a disappointment to me that a lot of kids today aren't especially fascinated by flight. I've watched countless children walk past the cockpit without paying much attention; they're too focused on their video games or their iPods.</p>
<p>When there are children who eagerly want a look inside &quot;my office&quot; at the front of the plane, their enthusiasm is contagious. It's so gratifying to see their excitement about something I care deeply about. If we aren't busy during boarding, the first officer and I enjoy inviting inquisitive children to sit in our seats in the cockpit, ask questions, and let their parents take photos of them wearing a captain's hat.</p>
<p>Being a pilot has a tangible end result that is beneficial to society. It feels good to take a planeload of 183 people where they need or want to go. My job is to reunite people with family and friends, to send them on long-awaited vacations, to bring them to loved ones' funerals, to get them to their job interviews. By the end of a day, after piloting three or four trips, I've taken four or five hundred people safely to their destinations, and I feel as if I've accomplished something. All of them have their own stories, motivations, needs—and helping them brings a rewarding feeling.</p>
<p>This is what gets me ready for work, and one of the things I look forward to.</p>
<p>I DID not kiss my wife good-bye.</p>
<p>It was five-thirty Monday morning, and I was leaving home for a four-day trip. My schedule had me piloting seven US Airways flights, with the last leg set for Thursday, January 15: Flight 1549 from New York to Charlotte.</p>
<p>I didn't kiss Lorrie because, over the years, I've come to realize that Lorrie is a light sleeper, and though I'd like to quietly kiss her before every trip and whisper &quot;I love you,&quot; doing so at 5:30 A.M. wouldn't be fair to her. I'd leave, and she'd be left there in bed, eyes open, to contemplate everything that she and our two daughters needed to do in the days ahead—all of it without me or my help.</p>
<p>Despite my passion for flying, the constant departures that define a pilot's life have been very hard on us. Gone from home about eighteen days per month, I have missed well over half of my children's lives.</p>
<p>My leaving isn't an indication that I love flying more than I love my wife and kids. In fact, Lorrie and I have talked in recent years about my doing something besides commercial aviation, something that would keep me closer to home. Despite the limits on how a man can reinvent himself, I've been confident about finding another way of meeting my family's financial needs that would equal being an airline captain. But I've wanted it to be a good fit that would take advantage of my life experiences. In the meantime, my dedication to the profession remains strong. And Lorrie knows me. She knows what flying means to me. We've found our ways to cope.</p>
<p>And so on that Monday, like so many before, I took my leave. Lorrie and our daughters, Kate, sixteen, and Kelly, fourteen, were fast asleep when I pulled the car out of our garage in Danville, California, and headed for San Francisco International Airport.</p>
<p>As the sun rose, I was already thirty-five miles away, crossing over San Francisco Bay on the San Mateo Bridge. I needed to be on a 7:30 A.M. flight to Charlotte—as a passenger.</p>
<p>Flight crews all have a base of operation, and mine is Charlotte, North Carolina. I used to be based in San Francisco, beginning in the early 1980s, when I flew for Pacific Southwest Airlines. In 1988, PSA merged with USAir, and I became a USAir pilot. In 1995, when USAir closed its San Francisco base, my base became Pittsburgh and then Charlotte. Lorrie and I wanted to remain in California, so like others based far from home, I've made a decision to commute across the country to start my work. We have chosen this life, and I'm grateful the airline allows it. Still, the logistics of it are wearying.</p>
<p>I don't have to pay for my flights to get to work, but I do have to go standby. If no seat is available, I can usually ride in the jumpseat in the cockpit. That's my ace in the hole. Mostly, though, I prefer to be in the back of the plane, out of the way of the pilots doing their job. In the back, I can read a book or close my eyes and try to sleep.</p>
<p>Because I'm in uniform, passengers will sometimes ask me a question about the flight, the turbulence, or how to best jam their overstuffed bags into the overhead compartment. Just as often, no one really notices me.</p>
<p>That's how it was on the flight that day to Charlotte. I sat there in my middle seat in coach, as anonymous as always, with no conception that by week's end everything would change. These were the final days of my old familiar life as a pilot.</p>
<p>I AM a man of routine, and there's a precision to my life that leaves Lorrie rolling her eyes sometimes. She says I'm very controlled and regimented, and though she believes that is part of what makes me a good pilot, it also makes me hard to live with on occasion. Lorrie knows other pilots' spouses who describe them the same way. Like me, they'll come home after days away and try to take charge, annoying loved ones by reorganizing the dishes in the dishwasher, finding a more efficient way to stack everything. I guess the flying culture—all our training—is what makes us so organized. Or, as Lorrie suspects, maybe there's a certain type of personality attracted to the profession.</p>
<p>In any case, I suppose I'm guilty as charged. But my exacting approach to things may serve me well in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>I had packed for this four-day trip the same way I pack for every four-day trip. I never want to bring more than necessary. I wore my captain's uniform—jacket and pants—and in my pilot's &quot;roll-aboard&quot; carry-on, brought three clean shirts, three pairs of underwear, three pairs of socks, my shaving kit, running shoes, an umbrella, an iPod, my laptop to check e-mail, and four books to read. I also had my American Express SkyGuide, which lists the complete North American flight schedule for all airlines. In a shirt pocket I had a US Airways trip sheet, with a full itinerary for the four days. Since my travels would take me to Pittsburgh and New York, where the weather would be cold and possibly snowy, I also brought a long winter overcoat, gloves, and a knit cap.</p>
<p>I enjoy listening to music on an iPod when I am in a city for an overnight. I always try to make a point of leaving the hotel to go for a walk, with music in my ears. Lately, I've been partial to Natalie Merchant, Green Day, the Killers, and Evanescence. I also find myself listening again and again to the works of Fritz Kreisler, the legendary Austrian violinist. He composed and recorded Liebesleid (Love's Sorrow) and Liebesfreud (Love's Joy), which is an inspiring sound track on a walk or run around a city, lost in your own thoughts.</p>
<p>In recent years, I've also been spending more time on the road focused on my future up the road. I am fifty-eight years old, and I face mandatory retirement from the cockpit when I turn sixty-five. What will I do then? Since September 11, 2001, the airline industry has been ailing, and as a result of cutbacks, I've lost 40 percent of my salary. Meanwhile, the US Airways pension I thought I could count on was terminated in 2004, and a government-backed replacement plan is a very weak substitute. As a result, I've lost more than two-thirds of my pension. My story is a familiar one across the airline industry.</p>
<p>Trying to earn money elsewhere, I've bought some real estate over the years, with mixed results. I own a property in Northern California that used to house a Jiffy Lube oil-change franchise. The operation didn't renew its lease, however, and I've been unable to find a new tenant. So as I sat on that flight to Charlotte, I went over some of those details in my head.</p>
<p>About a year ago, I also started my own side business, a consulting company called Safety Reliability Methods, Inc. It seemed like the right fit for me as my flying career winds down. Long before the landing in the Hudson, I'd been passionately involved in matters of air safety, dating back to my days as an Air Force fighter pilot. And so I brought three books on this four-day trip that were related to issues I want to address as a consultant.</p>
<p>I've been slowly building my firm, designed to help those in other occupations benefit from the airline industry's tactical and strategic approaches to safety. Pilots have extensive checklists that we follow in the cockpit. My firm encourages initiatives, such as those now under way in medicine, that mirror pilots' checklists. For instance, the World Health Organization now suggests the use of surgical safety checklists, requiring hospital teams to make certain that a patient's known allergies are checked, and instruments, needles, and sponges are counted to make sure none are left inside a patient.</p>
<p>I think commercial aviation is ultrasafe. Given the number of passengers we deliver safely to their destinations each day, and the relatively low risk associated with flying, our record so far is commendable. But airline companies must remain diligent, especially in the face of all the economic cutbacks plaguing the industry, or our good record could be compromised.</p>
<p>One of the books I had with me on that trip was Just Culture by Sidney Dekker, borrowed from my local library. Dekker writes about the balancing act between accountability and learning when it comes to people reporting safety issues. I have long believed that we can make a company culture, government, or community safer by encouraging people to report their own mistakes and safety deficiencies. So this book was a confirmation of my own study of these issues and my years of experience as a pilot.</p>
<p>As I sat in my middle seat on the way to Charlotte, I found myself reading and taking notes for my consulting business. I don't recall trading too many words with the passengers on either side of me.</p>
<p>When I'm a passenger in the back of a plane, though I'm reading or trying to nap or worrying about the shuttered Jiffy Lube, I still have a general awareness of how the flight is going and what the pilots are doing. I can feel the movements of the airplane. Most of my fellow passengers are engaged with their own books or are tapping away on their laptops, and they don't realize subtle things. But even when I'm not trying, I can tell when the plane is climbing or descending, or when the pilots are changing the flap setting or the engine thrust. For pilots, that general awareness comes with the territory.</p>
<p>The flight I was on had left San Francisco at 7:30 A.M. Pacific time, and arrived in Charlotte at 3:15 P.M. Eastern time. I got something to eat at the airport in Charlotte and then made my way to the gate for my first piloted flight of the four-day trip. I'd be going right back to San Francisco, flying an Airbus A321, carrying about 180 passengers.</p>
<p>Once I got to the gate, I smiled at some of the passengers and greeted the three flight attendants—Sheila Dail, Donna Dent, and Doreen Welsh. I had flown with Sheila and Donna before. I'm guessing I had shared trips with Doreen, too, some years ago, when we were both based in Pittsburgh. Because US Airways hasn't hired new flight attendants in years, all our crews are veterans. Doreen, now fifty-eight, joined the company in 1970 when it was Allegheny Airlines. That's thirty-eight years of experience. Both Sheila, fifty-seven, and Donna, fifty-one, have more than twenty-six years with the airline.</p>
<p>At the gate, I also shook hands with Jeff Skiles, the first officer who'd be flying with me. He and I had never met before, so we introduced ourselves. Along with Sheila, Donna, and Doreen, we'd be a team for the next four days.</p>
<p>Despite all my years as a pilot, it's common for me to have a first officer or flight attendants I've never met. Even after some serious downsizing, US Airways still has about 5,000 pilots and 6,600 flight attendants. It's impossible to know them all.</p>
<p>It is standard at our airline for a crew to have a brief meeting together at the start of a trip. It's vital to make individuals feel like a team quickly so that they can work almost as well together on the first flight as they naturally would after having flown several flights together. So before the passengers boarded we stood—Jeff, Sheila, Donna, Doreen, and I—in the aisle of the empty first-class cabin for a couple minutes, and I said a few words.</p>
<p>As the captain, it's up to me to set the tone. I want to be approachable. I asked the flight attendants to be my eyes and ears during the days ahead, to tell me about anything important that I couldn't observe from the cockpit. I asked them to let me know what they needed to do their jobs—catering, cleaning, whatever—and told them I'd try to help. I wanted them to know I was looking out for them. &quot;I can't get you your retirement plans back, but I can do a few things that will make your quality of life better. One of them is, when we arrive at our destination on the last flight of a day, I'll call the hotel and make sure that they've sent the van so we're not waiting for twenty minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>Jeff, forty-nine years old, was very friendly from the moment we said hello, and in the days to follow I'd learn more about him. Like me, he had earned his private pilot license at sixteen. But he came from an aviation family; both his parents were also pilots. He had worked for US Airways for twenty-three years, with twenty thousand flight hours, and had risen to be a captain. But due to cutbacks in flights and planes, and the effect on the pilots' seniority list, he was now flying as a first officer. I have twenty-nine years under my belt, so these days, I'm among the most senior of pilots at my airline.</p>
<p>Jeff had been flying the Boeing 737 for eight years, and had just completed training to fly the Airbus. These seven flights over four days with me actually would be his first trip on the Airbus without an instructor. As Jeff put it, &quot;It's my first trip without training wheels.&quot;</p>
<p>When I meet other pilots, I don't try to pigeonhole them. I figure I'll learn about them and their flying style in the cockpit. There's no need to rush to judgment. Still, my first impressions of Jeff were good ones.</p>
<p>From our initial moments together in the cockpit, for that flight to San Francisco, I found him to be conscientious and very well versed in everything about the Airbus. If he hadn't told me this was his first trip since being trained, I wouldn't have known.</p>
<p>Once pilots push back from the gate, and until we are above ten thousand feet in the air, cockpit crews aren't allowed to talk to each other about anything except the details of the flight. But after we were well on our way to San Francisco, Jeff and I were able to learn about each other. He told me he had three children, seventeen, fifteen, and twelve, and so we talked about our kids for a bit.</p>
<p>Somewhere over the snow-covered Rocky Mountains, I thought about that thrill I often get when I'm in the air, just taking in the majesty below, and the stars and planets around me, and appreciating all of it. It feels like we're floating through an invisible ocean of air, dotted with stars.</p>
<p>There's a poem I love, &quot;Sea Fever,&quot; by John Masefield, which includes the line: &quot;All I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by.&quot; I often think of that line when I see the planet Venus in the southwest corner of the sky as I head to the West Coast at certain times of the year. If I'm ever unable to access the global positioning system or use the compass in the cockpit, I know I'll be OK. I could just keep Venus in the left front corner of the windshield and we would reach California.</p>
<p>I mentioned to Jeff that I wished I could have my daughters take a flight with me in the cockpit of a commercial airliner, to see the pilot's-eye view of such scenes. In long-ago eras of aviation, that would have been possible. But in the wake of September 11, of course, restrictions on cockpit access were only increased. My girls will never see the skies through my eyes.</p>
<p>We also talked about our side jobs. Like a lot of pilots, Jeff also sees the need to supplement his income. He lives in Madison, Wisconsin, and has a business as a general contractor, building new homes.</p>
<p>Jeff said he'd Googled me before the trip because he was looking for my e-mail address. He wanted to share some scheduling information with me. Before the landing in the Hudson, of course, there wasn't much about me on the Internet. So the first thing he came upon was the Web site for my consulting business.</p>
<p>“I read all about your company,” he said, and then he just grinned. “Man, I thought I was a good bullshitter, but you take the cake!”</p>
<p>I was intrigued that he had Googled me—I don't ever recall flying with another pilot who had—and I was also amused by how direct he was. “I consider myself a connoisseur of bullshit,” he told me, “and you make that company of yours sound like it's this big operation. But then I read it more closely and I realized it's just you. You're the company. Good for you! I admire people who can take an acorn, and with a little bit of bullshit, make it into an oak.”</p>
<p>I know my business isn't a Fortune 500 empire, but I'd argue a bit with his characterization. I really am passionate about safety issues, and about what the airline industry can teach the world. I'm proud of my work, and told Jeff that. Still, I got a kick out of his straight-shooting style. We had a good laugh about my fledgling consulting operation as we made our way to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Jeff was at the controls for a lot of the trip, and I was impressed by the ease with which he was handling things. We were aware, of course, that because he had fewer than a hundred hours on the Airbus, there were restrictions we had to follow. He couldn't land or take off where runways might be contaminated by snow or ice. And certain airports—because of high terrain or complicated takeoff or landing procedures—were off-limits to him. San Francisco was one of these airports, so I needed to land the plane there.</p>
<p>When we finally touched down on the runway at 8:35 P.M., I was back exactly where I'd started at seven-thirty that morning. But the good news was there were no flight delays; it was still early enough. There was time for me to get to my car in the airport parking lot, and drive fifty minutes northeast to Danville, so I could spend the night with Lorrie and the kids.</p>
<p>This was a bonus layover. Instead of being gone, as usual, for the entire four-day trip, I got to go home.</p>
<p>WHEN I got into the house on that Monday night, it was nine forty-five and the girls were heading to bed. I didn't get to spend much time with them. But the next morning, I was able to drop them both off at school.</p>
<p>Kelly, now in eighth grade, had to be at her middle school by eight. I kissed her good-bye and told her I'd see her at the end of the week.</p>
<p>Then it was time to drive Kate to her high school. Actually, I was driven by Kate. She still had her driver's permit then, and was always looking to get experience, if not necessarily lessons. So she took the wheel and I got in the front passenger seat as a combination copilot and &quot;check airman.&quot; That's the term for a pilot who is an instructor accompanying another pilot to assess his or her skills.</p>
<p>Being with Kate at the wheel of the family SUV was like being with Jeff on the Airbus. I was observing, admiring, and taking notes.</p>
<p>My take on Kate is that she's a good driver, though a bit overconfident. She's also not sure all the rules of the road apply to her, so I've tried to impress upon her the fact that driving laws prevent anarchy. In the airline industry, we'd say she's &quot;selective about compliance.&quot; But overall, she's doing well. I'm pretty comfortable with her driving abilities, and told her so that morning. When she pulled up in front of her school, I kissed her and promised her I'd see her at the end of the week.</p>
<p>After I got back to the house, I made Lorrie a cup of tea and we had a pretty serious conversation. Because the Jiffy Lube franchisee had decided not to renew his lease six months earlier, and our commercial property—the land and the empty building—was still vacant, we were in serious financial straits. How long could we keep paying the mortgage without rent coming in? &quot;Not much longer,&quot; I told Lorrie, and we discussed whether we'd need to sell our family home to solve our money problems. That would be a worst-case scenario, we agreed, and we had several other contingency plans for dealing with this before we'd have to sell. Still, it was a sobering and unresolved dilemma that would have to be tabled until my return later in the week. I needed to head back to the airport in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Before I left home, I made myself two sandwiches, one turkey and one peanut butter and jelly, and put them in a lunch bag along with a banana. This also has become part of my ritual. Until the last eight years or so, airlines provided meals for pilots and flight attendants on long flights. Economic cutbacks have ended that little perk.</p>
<p>On this day, because it was later in the morning, I was able to kiss Lorrie good-bye. An hour later I was at the airport again, preparing to pilot the A319 Airbus to Pittsburgh. Once Jeff and I got the plane into the air and on its way, those sandwiches and the banana served me well.</p>
<p>Much about flying has a hold on me. I still find it satisfying on many fronts—especially when I look out the cockpit window. I am grateful for all the adventures to be found at thirty thousand feet. But I've got to be honest: Eating PB&amp;J while smelling the gourmet beef being distributed with wine in first class—that's a sure reminder that there are less-than-glamorous aspects of my job.</p>
<p>After we landed in Pittsburgh on that Tuesday night, I got in a van with Jeff and the flight attendants and we headed over to the La Quinta Inn &amp; Suites near the airport.</p>
<p>We had to be flying again exactly ten hours later. This was close to what we call a &quot;minimum night.&quot; Minimum rest for a crew overnighting between flights is nine hours and fifteen minutes. It sounds like enough time, but it's actually pretty tight. The clock starts ticking the minute the plane arrives and is blocked in at the gate. It continues until push-back of the next morning's flight. In between, we have to get out of the airplane, and to and from the hotel. We have to leave for the airport at least an hour, and sometimes ninety minutes, before the morning flight. Add in time for showering and getting something to eat, and our actual time sleeping is usually about six and a half hours.</p>
<p>Our flight that morning to LaGuardia Airport in New York left at 7:05. Because it was snowing, I handled the controls. We arrived at 8:34, got a new load of passengers, and were slated to head back to Pittsburgh at 9:15 A.M. Because of weather and traffic, we had a forty-five-minute delay on the ground at LaGuardia.</p>
<p>I still have my trip sheet from that week, and as always, I had scribbled notations alongside each flight. I keep track of all the actual flight times, to make sure I get paid properly. Pilots are paid per hour of flying, and &quot;flying&quot; is tallied from the moment you move away from the gate in one city to the moment you arrive at the gate in the next city.</p>
<p>Delays frustrate everybody—pilots, too, of course—but the fact is that we start getting paid when the plane has pushed back from the gate. If we sit on the tarmac for hours, we're getting paid. If we're waiting at the gate, we're not.</p>
<p>Anyway, we got back to Pittsburgh before noon, and because we had a long layover of twenty-two hours until the next leg of our trip, we were able to spend Wednesday night farther from the airport, at the Hilton downtown. I went for a walk around Pittsburgh that afternoon by myself, bundled up in the snow, listening to my iPod. Jeff and I talked about having dinner together, but he had something to do, and so I was alone that night. The flight attendants were also on their own.</p>
<p>Because most US Airways flight crews are older now—no young blood has been hired for years—we're more tired and less social than we used to be. The wilder &quot;Coffee, Tea, or Me&quot; days are long over, and mostly predated my airline career. About a third to half of flight attendants and pilots these days are what those of us in the industry call &quot;slam clickers&quot;; they slam the doors to their hotel rooms and click the locks. They don't socialize and they spend their entire layovers in their rooms.</p>
<p>Granted, most of them aren't really slamming their doors. They say good night nicely and then disappear.</p>
<p>I understand that the constant travel is a grind, and that my colleagues are tired or don't want to go out on the town, wasting money. And I'm not a partyer by any stretch. But I decided a long time ago that if I was going to be gone from home sixteen or eighteen days a month—spending 60 percent of my time away from my family—I wasn't going to waste half my life sitting in a hotel room watching cable TV. And so I try at least to take a walk or go for a run. I'll visit a new restaurant, even if I'm by myself. I try to have a life. If members of the flight crew want to join me, I'm grateful for their company. If not, I'm comfortable on my own.</p>
<p>On that Wednesday night, I called home and talked to my daughters. I described my walk in the snow, and asked them about what they were up to at school. They are teens now, wrapped up in their own lives, so they're not hugely engaged in hearing details of my day. I'm always actively searching for ways to connect with them, to keep things fresh.</p>
<p>The next morning, January 15, it was snowing, and Jeff and I needed to take an Airbus A321 from Pittsburgh down to Charlotte.</p>
<p>Because of the de-icing in Pittsburgh, we were thirty minutes late arriving in Charlotte. And we switched planes there, from an Airbus A321 to an A320. That A320 was the plane that would take us to the Hudson. The flight from Charlotte landed at LaGuardia just after 2 P.M. It had been snowing in New York, but by the time we arrived, the snow had stopped.</p>
<p>At LaGuardia, the gate agents started loading the new passengers onto the plane. I got the flight plan for the next leg—Flight 1549 from New York back to Charlotte—and then ran to find something to eat. I bought a tuna sandwich for eight dollars and change, and expected I'd get to eat it once we were at cruising altitude on our return to Charlotte.</p>
<p>Back at the gate, passengers had begun boarding, and I didn't get a chance to say anything to any of them. Some would later remark that I looked older with my gray hair, and they felt reassured that I was a veteran pilot. I just nodded and smiled at a few of them as I made my way back into the cockpit with my sandwich.</p>
<p>While the plane was being serviced, I checked the fuel load and the weather, and then went over the flight plan. As first officer, Jeff's job was to take a walk around the exterior of the plane, making an inspection. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary to either of us.</p>
<p>It was a full flight, 150 passengers, plus the crew—me, Jeff, Sheila, Donna, and Doreen. Just before we pushed back from the gate, Jeff and I remarked to each other that we had enjoyed flying together. This would be the final leg of our trip. I was planning to leave Charlotte at 5:50 P.M., flying home to San Francisco as a passenger, and Jeff was going to head back that evening to Wisconsin.</p>
<p>We pushed back from the gate at 3:03 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, and we joined the queue of airplanes waiting for our turn to take off.</p>
<p>In our ears, Jeff and I heard the constant chatter on the party line of the LaGuardia Tower Air Traffic Control frequency. We were listening in and watching as airplanes took off and landed on the two intersecting runways at one of the nation's busiest airports. As happens every day, it was a carefully choreographed ballet where everyone knew their parts exceedingly well.</p>
<p>At 3:20 P.M. and thirty-six seconds, the tower controller spoke to us: &quot;Cactus fifteen forty-nine, LaGuardia, runway four position and hold, traffic will land three one.&quot; The tower controller was instructing us to taxi onto the active runway and hold in position to await clearance for takeoff. He was also advising us that we would see traffic landing on the intersecting runway 31. (&quot;Cactus&quot; is the radio call sign for US Airways flights. The airline chose it after we combined with the former America West Airlines. Though it was adopted to preserve the heritage of America West, some pilots and controllers would prefer that we had kept our old call sign, &quot;USAir,&quot; to avoid confusion. Having a name that doesn't match the name painted on the side of an airplane can be confusing, particularly at foreign airports.)</p>
<p>At 3:20:40, as I was taxiing, Jeff responded to the controller: &quot;Position and hold runway four for Cactus fifteen forty-nine.&quot;</p>
<p>We then sat on the runway for four minutes and fourteen seconds, listening to controllers and pilots trading concise esoteric exchanges such as &quot;American three seventy-eight cleared to land three one, wind zero three zero, one zero, traffic will hold on four.&quot; This was the tower controller clearing American Flight 378 to land on runway 31, telling him the wind was from the northeast at ten knots, and advising him that Jeff and I were holding in position on runway 4.</p>
<p>At 3:24:54, from controller to me and Jeff: &quot;Cactus fifteen forty-nine runway four, cleared for takeoff.&quot;</p>
<p>At 3:24:56, from me to controller: &quot;Cactus fifteen forty-nine cleared for takeoff.&quot;</p>
<p>On the runway, shortly after we started rolling, I said, &quot;Eighty,&quot; and Jeff answered, &quot;Checked.&quot; That was the airspeed check. Our language was exactly by the book.</p>
<p>Then I said, &quot;V1,&quot; an indication that I was monitoring the velocity of the airplane and that we had passed the point where we could abort our takeoff and still stop on the remaining portion of the runway. We were now obligated to continue the takeoff. A few seconds later, I said, &quot;Rotate.&quot; That was my callout to Jeff that we had reached the speed at which he should pull back on the sidestick, causing the aircraft to lift off. We were airborne and it was very routine.</p>
<p>At 3:25:44, from the controller to me and Jeff: &quot;Cactus fifteen forty-nine, contact New York departure, good day.&quot; We were being told that future communications for our flight were being handed off to the controller at New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, located on Long Island.</p>
<p>At 3:25:48, from me to the LaGuardia controller: &quot;Good day.&quot;</p>
<p>To that point, my four-day trip had been completely unremarkable, and as with almost every other takeoff and landing I'd experienced in forty-two years as a pilot, I expected this flight to remain unremarkable.</p>
<p>We'd even made up a little time caused by the delays earlier in the day. So I was in a good mood. The Charlotte–San Francisco flight was still showing on time, and a middle seat was available. It looked like I'd make it home while Lorrie and the girls were still awake.</p>
<h3 id="3-those-who-came-before-me">3 Those Who Came Before Me</h3>
<p>AS HUMAN ENDEAVORS go, aviation is a very recent one. The Wright brothers first flew in 1903. That's just 106 years ago. I'm fifty-eight years old, and I've been flying for forty-two of those years. Aviation is so young that I've been involved in it for almost half of its history.</p>
<p>Through the efforts of many people in the past 106 years—their hard work, their practice, their engineering breakthroughs—aviation has quickly gone from its dangerous infancy to being so commonplace that there is little tolerance for any risk at all. We may have made it look too easy. People have forgotten what's at stake.</p>
<p>I'm not saying passengers shouldn't feel comfortable flying. It's just that it's easy to become complacent when our nation can sometimes go a year or two between major airline accidents involving fatalities. When things are going well, success can hide inefficiencies and deficiencies. And so it takes constant vigilance.</p>
<p>Long before I found myself in the cockpit of Flight 1549, I had closely studied other airline accidents. There is much to be learned from the experiences of pilots who were involved in the seminal accidents of recent decades. I have soberly paged through transcripts from cockpit voice recorders, with the last exchanges of pilots who didn't survive.</p>
<p>I studied these accidents partly because, in the early 1990s, I had joined a couple dozen other US Airways pilots to help develop an air-safety course looking at CRM—crew resource management. Before Flight 1549, my proudest professional contribution was my work in CRM. My fellow facilitators and I helped change the culture of our airline's pilot group by improving cockpit communication, leadership, and decision making. As First Officer Jeff Diercksmeier, my friend on the CRM team, said, &quot;It was a time when a few people who really believed in what they were doing made a difference.&quot;</p>
<p>My interest in air safety goes back to my first flights as a teenager. I've always wanted to know how some pilots handled challenging situations and made the best decisions. These were men and women worth emulating.</p>
<p>And so I tried to understand, intimately, the full stories behind each of these pilot's actions. I'd ask myself: If I had been there, would I have been as successful?</p>
<p>A few years ago, I was invited to speak at an international conference in France focused on safety issues in a variety of industries. Given the comparatively ultrasafe record of commercial aviation, I was asked to appear on two panels to discuss how airline safety efforts might be transferable elsewhere. I talked about how other industries are recognizing that they can benefit by adopting some of our approaches.</p>
<p>This degree of safety requires tremendous commitment at every level of an organization and a constant diligence and vigilance to make it a reality.</p>
<p>Those of us who are pilots worry about the financial issues now weighing down airlines. Most passengers today select carriers based on price. If one airline's fare is five dollars less than a competitor's fare, the airline with the less costly ticket gets the booking. The net effect is that airlines are under intense pressure to lower their costs so they can offer competitive fares. This has cheapened the experience of flying; we've all seen the cutbacks in amenities offered in coach. But passengers don't see other ways in which the airlines are cutting back. For instance, some of the smaller regional airlines have lowered the minimum requirements for pilot recruitment, and they're paying some pilots $16,000 a year. Veteran pilots—those who have the experience that would help them in emergencies—won't take these jobs.</p>
<p>I have 19,700 flight hours now. Back when I had, say, 2,000 or 4,000 hours of experience, I knew a lot of things, but I did not yet possess the depth of understanding I have now. Since then, I've sharpened my skills and learned from many situations that tested and taught me. Regional airlines will now take someone with 200 hours of flying experience and make him or her a first officer. These new pilots may have exceptional training, and they may have a high degree of ability. But it takes time, hour after hour, to master the science and art of flying a commercial jet.</p>
<p>Another issue: Airlines used to have more large hangars in which their planes were repaired and maintained by their own mechanics. The mechanics would overhaul component parts, radios, brakes, engines. They knew the specific parts and systems in each aircraft in their fleet. Now many airlines have outsourced their maintenance and component work. Are these outside mechanics as experienced and knowledgeable about a particular aircraft? If a part is sent overseas to be overhauled, does it come back as reliable?</p>
<p>It's fair to say that when jobs are outsourced, and the work is done in a remote location, an airline has to work much harder to control the entire process, and to have the same level of confidence in the part or repair.</p>
<p>Every choice we in the airline industry make based solely on cost has ramifications and should be evaluated carefully. We have to constantly consider the unintended consequences for safety.</p>
<p>An airline accident is almost always the end result of a causal chain of events. If any one link was different, the outcome may have been different. Almost no accident was the result of just one problem. In most cases, one thing led to another, and then there was too much risk and a bad outcome. In aviation, we need to keep looking at the links in the chain.</p>
<p>Engine manufacturers know, for example, that their engines might someday encounter and ingest a flock of birds, causing severe damage. To learn what they're up against, the manufacturers use farm-raised birds to test their engines. These preslaughtered birds are fired into the spinning blades from pneumatic cannons—sacrificed in the name of research that might save human lives. Given the growing population of birds near many airports, this testing is crucial.</p>
<p>Birds certainly are entitled to their wide piece of the sky, but if we humans are to continue joining them there in ever larger numbers, we'll need to have a better understanding of the risks and remedies of bird strikes. In the wake of Flight 1549, investigators will likely consider whether an improvement in engine certification standards is needed.</p>
<p>Historically, safety advances in aviation often have been purchased with blood. It seems sometimes we've had to wait until the body count has risen high enough to create public awareness or political will. The worst air tragedies have led to the most important changes in design, training, regulations, or airline practices.</p>
<p>Airline disasters get massive media coverage, and the public's reaction in response to these tragedies has helped focus government and industry attention on safety issues.</p>
<p>People have incredibly high expectations for airline travel, and they should. But they don't always put the risks in perspective. Consider that more than thirty-seven thousand people died in auto accidents in the United States last year. That was about seven hundred a week, yet we never heard about most of those fatalities because they happened one or two at a time. Now imagine if seven hundred people were dying every week in airline accidents; the equivalent of a commercial jet crashing almost every day. The airports would be shut down and every airliner would be grounded.</p>
<p>In aviation, we should always aim for zero accidents. To come closer to accomplishing this, we must have the integrity to always do the right things, even if they cost more money. We have to build on all the hard work of the last 106 years, and not assume we can just rely on the progress made by previous generations. We need to keep renewing our investments in people, systems, and technologies to maintain the high level of safety we all deserve. It won't happen by itself. We have to choose to do this. This same prescription applies to many other industries and occupations.</p>
<p>Commercial aviation is one of several professions in which knowledge, skill, diligence, judgment, and experience are so important. With the lives of hundreds of passengers in our care, pilots know the stakes are high. That's why, long before Flight 1549, I read about and learned from the experiences of others. It matters.</p>
<p>WHEN I arrived in the cockpit of Flight 1549, I would be aided by the courageous efforts of pilots who had come before me.</p>
<p>There were the two unheralded test pilots who, on September 20, 1944, risked their lives by landing their B-24 Liberator in Virginia's James River. This was a voluntary ditching, considered the first test on a full-size aircraft. As the plane hydroplaned for several hundred feet, which almost completely severed the bomber's nose section, engineers watched from a nearby boat, collecting data on how it fared. The pilots survived.</p>
<p>The following day, the Daily Press in Newport News had this headline: B-24 “DITCHED” TO EXPERIMENT ON STRUCTURES—JAMES RIVER TEST DESIGNED TO SAVE LIVES IN THE FUTURE.</p>
<p>By that day in 1944, the Allies had already ditched scores of bombers in World War II, often in the English Channel. Most filled with water and sank quickly; hundreds of crew members drowned. Better procedures for ditching were desperately needed.</p>
<p>As a recent Daily Press story explained, it took thirteen more years after that test in Virginia for a full report to be written on how best to attempt a water landing while piloting a distressed aircraft. That report called for landing gear to be retracted rather than extended. It described why an airplane should fly as slowly as possible, and why wing flaps should be down for impact. It also called for the nose to be up in most cases. These procedural guidelines remain in use today, and were in my head on Flight 1549.</p>
<p>As a student of history, I am awed when I read of the actions taken by these pilots in earlier eras. They didn't have all the data that now aids us in our decisions. They didn't have the benefit of all the additional decades of trial and error in aircraft design. They acted with the mental and physical tool kits available to them.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous water landing prior to Flight 1549 happened on October 16, 1956. It was Pan American Airways Flight 6, bound from Honolulu to San Francisco with twenty-five passengers. There were also forty-four cases of live canaries in the cargo hold.</p>
<p>In the middle of the Pacific, in the middle of the night, the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser lost two engines, and its remaining two engines were under strain, consuming large amounts of fuel.</p>
<p>Captain Richard Ogg, forty-two years old, knew he was too far into the trip to turn back to Hawaii. San Francisco was too far ahead. And so he opted for a water landing. He circled for several hours, burning off fuel and waiting for daylight, above a U.S. Coast Guard cutter that was in position to rescue passengers and crew.</p>
<p>Just before 8 A.M., the captain attempted his landing. The tail snapped off and the nose was shattered on impact, but all the passengers and crew were rescued. Captain Ogg went through the plane twice, making sure he didn't leave anyone behind. The plane took twenty-one minutes to sink below the surface of the Pacific.</p>
<p>The circumstances of Flight 6 were different from my experience on Flight 1549, mostly because Captain Ogg had hours to work on his plan and Jeff and I didn't even have minutes. Also, he was landing on the open ocean, not on a river. But I had long admired Captain Ogg's ability to safely land on water. I knew that not all pilots could have successfully equaled his effort.</p>
<p>After Flight 1549 hit the news, the San Francisco Chronicle contacted Captain Ogg's widow, Peggy, to ask her about the similarities between my landing in the Hudson and her husband's 1956 ditching in the Pacific. She spoke of her husband's sense of duty. He had told reporters at the time: &quot;We had a certain job to do. We had to do it right or else.&quot;</p>
<p>When Captain Ogg was on his deathbed in 1991, his wife was sitting with him and noticed a faraway look on his face. She asked him what he was thinking about. He told her: &quot;I was thinking of those poor canaries that drowned in the hold when I had to ditch the plane.&quot;</p>
<p>THE FIRST major airline accident I ever investigated personally was PSA Flight 1771, which crashed into hilly ranchland near Cayucos, California, on December 7, 1989. It was traveling from Los Angeles to San Francisco.</p>
<p>The specifics of the crash were haunting and disturbing. A former USAir ticket agent named David Burke, thirty-five years old, had been caught on a security videotape allegedly stealing sixty-nine dollars in in-flight cocktail receipts. He was fired, and tried unsuccessfully to get his job back. He then decided to buy a ticket on Flight 1771 because his supervisor was a passenger on it.</p>
<p>In that era before the September 11 attacks, those with airport IDs didn't necessarily have to go through security. So Burke was able to board the plane carrying a .44 Magnum revolver. Sometime after boarding, he wrote a note on an airsickness bag to his supervisor: &quot;Hi Ray: I think it's sort of ironical that we ended up like this. I asked for some leniency for my family. Remember? Well, I got none and you'll get none.&quot;</p>
<p>The plane was at twenty-two thousand feet when the cockpit voice recorder picked up the sound of what appeared to be shots being fired in the cabin. Then a flight attendant was heard entering the cockpit. &quot;We have a problem,&quot; she said. The captain answered: &quot;What kind of problem?&quot; Burke was then heard saying: &quot;I'm the problem!&quot;</p>
<p>The sounds of a struggle and gunshots followed. Investigators believed Burke shot the captain and first officer, and then himself, after which the plane went into a nosedive, probably because a pilot's body was slumped against the controls. The plane hit the ground at about seven hundred miles an hour and much of it disintegrated on impact. None of the forty-three people on board survived.</p>
<p>As an Air Line Pilots Association safety committee volunteer, I served as an investigator at the crash site as part of the &quot;survival factors&quot; working group, charged with trying to determine what the crew could have done to make that flight survivable. Of course, given the circumstances, there was almost nothing they could have done. The FBI quickly took over and turned the crash site into a crime scene. Over the days of searching, the handgun was recovered with six spent cartridges. So was the note on the airsickness bag, and Burke's identification badge, which he had used to avoid going through security.</p>
<p>When I got there, the crash site looked like an outdoor rock concert where everyone had left trash all over a hillside. There were hardly any big pieces of the plane besides landing gear forgings and engine cores. It was a very disturbing feeling being at the scene of a mass murder, knowing what had happened in the sky above us. The smell in the air was a mixture of jet fuel and death.</p>
<p>I had known one of the flight attendants on the plane, and it was horrifying to imagine what the crew and passengers went through. Working on this sort of investigation focuses your attention on how to prevent similar tragedies in the future. It renews your dedication to never let it happen again.</p>
<p>In the wake of Flight 1771, some groups of airline workers were subjected to security requirements similar to those set for passengers, better methods of employment verification were instituted, and federal law required employees to turn in their IDs after being terminated from airline jobs. But larger problems with security would still need to be addressed. Standing on that hillside in California, I couldn't have imagined the way cockpits would be breached on September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>In my role helping with accident investigations, I also was called upon to talk to passengers who survived crashes.</p>
<p>On February 1, 1991, there was a runway collision at Los Angeles International Airport between USAir Flight 1493 and SkyWest Airlines Flight 5569. It happened in part because the local air traffic controller cleared the USAir jet, a 737-3B7, to land while the SkyWest commuter plane, a Fairchild Metro III, was holding in position to take off on the same runway. All twelve people on the SkyWest plane died, and twenty-three were killed on the 737. I was given the task of interviewing some of the sixty-seven survivors from the 737.</p>
<p>The NTSB gave us a long questionnaire, with questions such as: What announcements do you recall hearing? Did the emergency exit lights come on? Which exit did you use to escape? Did you help anyone else get out? Did anyone help you get out?</p>
<p>All of these questions were designed to help the airline industry learn from these events and improve the next outcome.</p>
<p>It was not especially pleasant work investigating accidents, but I was grateful for the opportunities to do so. When I talked to survivors, I listened carefully, trying to understand, and I filed away the details, in case I'd ever need to draw on them.</p>
<h3 id="4-measure-twice-cut-once">4 &quot;Measure Twice, Cut Once&quot;</h3>
<p>I GREW UP in a home where each of us had our own hammer.</p>
<p>When I think about the work ethic and the values that carried me through life, and through seven million miles as a pilot, I think at times about the hammer my dad gave me as a boy.</p>
<p>He had married my mom in 1948, bought a piece of farmland from her parents, and borrowed $3,000 to build a house on it. It was a very small ranch house, just one bedroom. But over the years that followed, my dad devoted himself to enlarging the homestead again and again. He built a series of additions with the help of three not-always-willing assistants: my mother, my sister, and me.</p>
<p>My parents were born in Denison, Texas, and my mom only lived in two homes her entire life, and they were within one mile of each other. The first was her childhood home, built around 1918 by my grandfather, Russell Hanna, who used materials he found right there on the property. He cleared the land of a great number of large stones, cut them with the help of a hired hand, and used them to build the house and other farm structures. From that home, my mom at age twenty-one moved just down the road to the little place she built with my dad. She'd live there, on Hanna Drive, for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>Certainly, my maternal grandfather could have named that gravel road First Avenue or Main Street or whatever. But the road led to his property, and so it bore his name. That's where I grew up, 11100 Hanna Drive, an ever-expanding house next to Lake Texoma, eleven miles outside of Denison.</p>
<p>My dad's father, who died before I was born, owned a planing mill—a final processing plant for lumber—and my paternal grandmother continued to be involved in the office operations after he was gone. It was right there in Denison, and when I was a young boy, I'd visit and play happily in the huge mounds of sawdust. The place was thick with the sounds of giant woodworking machinery and the wonderful smell of lumber. There was also a cool device on my grandmother's desk, a coil-springed gadget shaped like a human hand and made of stamped-out sheet metal. My grandmother stored envelopes and paperwork between the hand's fingers. Having grown up in that mill, my dad had a love and knowledge of woodworking, and of making things with his hands. By adulthood, he was a very able handyman.</p>
<p>That helps explain why, every few years when I was a kid, my dad would announce that it was time to enlarge the house. He and my mom would decide we needed a new bedroom or a larger living room. &quot;Let's get to work,&quot; my dad would say, and we'd pull out the tools. He was a dentist, but he had taken drafting courses in high school. He had a big plywood drafting table he had made himself, and he'd sit there for hours with his T square and a pencil, drawing up plans. He was always reading Popular Mechanics and Popular Science, clipping articles about the latest home-building techniques.</p>
<p>The goal was to do everything ourselves, to learn what we didn't know and then have at it. My dad taught himself to do the carpentry, the electrical installations, even the roofing—and then he taught us. When we were doing the plumbing, my dad and I would heat the copper joints together, holding the solder, letting it melt from the tip of a soft wire. When we did electrical work, we knew we had to get it right: If we didn't, we risked electrocuting ourselves or burning down the house. None of this was easy, but it was satisfying on a lot of levels, and we were learning how to learn.</p>
<p>My father liked to use craftsmen's adages, such as &quot;Measure twice, cut once.&quot; The first time I heard that particular phrase was after I had cut a piece of wood to go in the framing of one of our hallway walls. I cut it without paying close enough attention and it turned out to be too short.</p>
<p>&quot;Go get another two-by-four,&quot; my dad told me, &quot;and this time, measure more precisely. Then start over and measure everything again. Make sure you get a consistent answer. Then cut the board a little wide of the mark, just to give yourself an option. You can always make a board shorter. You can't make it longer.&quot;</p>
<p>I did as I was told, very carefully, and the board fit right where it belonged in the wall. My dad smiled at me. &quot;Measure twice,&quot; he said. &quot;Cut once. Remember that.&quot;</p>
<p>THE FOUR hammers in the house, one for each of us, got a huge workout. In the morning, before it got too hot, my dad would send us up on the roof to pound nails into the shingles. He never considered hiring a contractor or a roofing crew. For one thing, we didn't have extra money for that. And besides, as my dad saw it, this was a great family activity.</p>
<p>My sister, Mary, smiles at her memory of my dad driving us into nearby Sherman, where he had once come upon a certain house owned by a stranger. He loved that house. So when we were in grade school, he'd bring the whole family to sit in front of it while he sketched on a drawing pad, studying the parts of the structure that he liked. One day he'd sketch the roofline. A week later he'd come back and sketch the front steps. He wanted our house to look like that house, and he found his way by sketching the particulars.</p>
<p>My sister likes to say that watching my father expand our house showed her that anything is possible. &quot;You can learn anything you want to learn,&quot; she says, &quot;if you sit and figure things out logically, if you study something similar, if you keep working at it. You can start with a blank piece of paper and end up with a house.&quot;</p>
<p>This idea that &quot;anything is possible&quot; has been a bit of a mantra in my adult life, especially in my marriage. Lorrie reintroduced me to those words. And at the same time, my father's example remains there in the back of my mind, showing me the way.</p>
<p>That's not to say I always fully embraced my father's sense of the possibilities. On Saturdays, when my sister and I would have loved to sleep in, he'd wake us up at 7 A.M. so we could get an early start on whatever the latest expansion was. We'd work until lunchtime and then he'd suggest that we take a nap so we'd have the energy to get back to work later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Even if we couldn't fall asleep, we pretended, so he wouldn't send us back to work right away. &quot;Just keep your eyes closed,&quot; Mary would whisper to me. &quot;He'll think we're still sleeping.&quot;</p>
<p>Though we dragged our feet at times, I did feel I had a stake in all of the construction work. I wanted to do a good job so all the additions would look right. Even in grade school and junior high, I felt committed to getting the masonry right, because I'd have to look at it every day. Also, I didn't want my friends to come over and notice that I lived in a place built by a bunch of amateurs.</p>
<p>The house was a source of pride, but I also felt a bit of embarrassment. Sometimes I'd brood, wishing we lived in a professionally built house like everyone else. I told myself that when I grew up, I'd live in a house where all the floors were completely level, where all the joints were square. To save money, my father also kept the heat low in the winter. I vowed to live in a house where it was never cold.</p>
<p>And yet, despite my mostly unvoiced complaints, I knew that working on the house was a special experience. Each time the place grew, I felt a sense of accomplishment. The house expansion was a tangible activity, not theoretical or intellectual. We saw the progress we made. We'd put in long days, especially in the summertime, but by nightfall, we could see that things were different from when we started in the morning. I liked that.</p>
<p>I've always liked seeing results. One chore I never minded doing as a boy was mowing the grass on our half-acre lot. When I was halfway through mowing, I knew how much I had left to go. When I was finished, I could tell I'd made a difference. The lawn looked neater. Flying for an airline offers equal satisfaction: We're halfway there. We've landed. We've completed our job.</p>
<p>MY GRANDPARENTS were all born between 1885 and 1893. All four attended college, which was especially remarkable for my grandmothers, given the times they lived in. My grandparents raised both of my parents with the belief that schooling was paramount, but that a lot also could be learned outside of formal education.</p>
<p>My father was born in 1917 and kept a journal when he was a teen that he later allowed me to read. The Depression became vivid to me as I paged through all of his journal entries. Money was always an issue, and he had a series of overlapping jobs in high school. He'd balance his schoolwork with two paper routes and duties as a movie-theater usher.</p>
<p>My grandfather would sometimes run out of money at the end of the month, and he'd borrow money from my father. In his journal, my father chronicled his pluckiness, describing how he'd find ways to cope in hard times. When he had a little bit of money and could eat at the local diner, he'd order a bowl of chili and fill it with saltines and ketchup to make it a more substantial meal. It kept him from going hungry.</p>
<p>Reading my dad's diary, I got to better understand his worldview. It was a reminder of how much easier things were for my generation. I understood why my dad kept the heat turned down, and his kids hammering away at the house. Those with the Depression-era mentality never could quite shake it.</p>
<p>My dad ended up going to Baylor College of Dentistry in Dallas, graduated in June 1941, and decided to join the Navy. This was six months before Pearl Harbor was attacked.</p>
<p>He had always liked airplanes, and hoped to become a naval aviator. He even passed the rigorous physical exam. But then, at the last minute, he decided that since he had been trained in dentistry, perhaps he'd serve his country best as a dentist. It was a fateful decision. He entered the service with friends who did go on to become Navy pilots. They were killed in the fierce fighting early in the war. My father always assumed that if he had become an aviator, he would have been shot down with them.</p>
<p>He was stationed as a dental surgeon first in San Diego and then in Hawaii. He never was in combat, but plenty of men who saw the worst of it took their seats in his dental chair. Between 1941 and 1945, hundreds of those who'd been in battles told him their stories as they passed through Hawaii.</p>
<p>He took his work as a military dentist very seriously, and he learned things from the men who came through his dental office, especially the officers. When I was a boy, he would talk about the great obligations of a commander to look after every aspect of everyone's welfare who served under him. My dad made it clear to me how hard it would be for a commander to live with himself if, through lack of foresight or an error in judgment, he got someone hurt or killed.</p>
<p>When I was a boy, he impressed upon me that a commander's job is full of challenges, and his responsibilities are almost a sacred duty. I kept my father's words with me during my own military career, and after that, when I became an airline pilot, with hundreds of passengers in my care.</p>
<p>My dad left the service as a full commander, and after World War II, he opened a dental practice in Denison. He loved talking to patients, and listening to what they had to say when his hands weren't in their mouths. But he wasn't much of a businessman. He had no ambition to run a large practice with a half-dozen associates, or to slave away for more than thirty-five or forty hours a week. Money didn't motivate him, and he never made too much or managed it particularly well. He didn't need a lot of material things, and figured we didn't either. Paying for my flying lessons was an indulgence, but he thought my time learning to fly with Mr. Cook gave me a sense of purpose and a path into the future. He was happy to find the money for that.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of men of his generation, my dad thought of being with his family as his priority; work was secondary. I wouldn't say he was without ambition—after all, he built his own house—but he was content making less money if that meant he could spend more time with us.</p>
<p>It was almost as if he wasn't in dentistry to earn a living. A lot of the nuns from the local Catholic school were his patients. Sometimes they had the money to pay him, sometimes they didn't. He had other patients like that. Some people didn't get charged. Some didn't get charged much.</p>
<p>My father could also be a bit whimsical and impulsive. Or perhaps, as I'd later suspect, he was just looking for ways to brighten days when he was weighed down by darker moods. In any case, some mornings he'd wake up and say to my mother, &quot;I don't feel like working today. Let's go to Dallas.&quot;</p>
<p>My mom would get on the phone and cancel all his patient appointments, then she'd call our school to say we wouldn't be coming in. My father figured my sister and I were smart kids; we could make up any missed schoolwork. And besides, he felt we could always learn something down in Dallas.</p>
<p>It was exciting. The whole family would drive the seventy-five miles listening to Top 40 songs on KLIF-AM on the car radio. When we got to Dallas, we'd see a movie and have an inexpensive dinner together.</p>
<p>We always stayed at the same little roadside one-story motel, a typical fifties-era row of rooms right off the freeway: the Como Motel. We'd swim in the small swimming pool in the middle of the parking lot. And we always ate at a Mexican restaurant called El Chico. Every meal, no matter what you ordered, came with rice and beans. I'd always get the cheese enchiladas, which I loved because of the diced onions inside.</p>
<p>El Chico had one large, open dining room with a high ceiling, and on the west wall was a huge mural of a Mayan—or maybe it was an Incan—outdoor scene. The focal point of the mural was a man with a native cloth around his waist and a bare upper torso. He was filling a jug with water, and I'd sit there eating my enchiladas and studying that guy in the mural. Every time we ate there, he was still filling that water jug.</p>
<p>We went to the same movie theater, the Inwood Theater, which had great air-conditioning at a time when it was a rarity in public places. That's where I saw two James Bond movies, Dr. No in 1962 when I was eleven, and Goldfinger in 1964 when I was thirteen.</p>
<p>Dallas was pretty cosmopolitan for us. It wasn't that large a city then, but it looked big to us, with its freeways and traffic and businesspeople walking around. John F. Kennedy was shot in 1963, and we may have driven by Dealey Plaza a few months after the assassination on the way somewhere. But we weren't gawkers. We didn't make a special trip to see it.</p>
<p>These spontaneous little getaways to Dallas were a continual reminder to me about my dad's appreciation of the distinctions between work and family. Family came first. Ahead of work and ahead of school. That's how my dad lived long before &quot;work-life balance&quot; became a popular catchphrase.</p>
<p>I have great memories of my family life closer to home, too. We had a small boat, and on weekends we'd take it out on Lake Texoma, which covered eighty-nine thousand acres. My mom was a terrific water-skier, and she could make it halfway across the lake, like the Energizer Bunny on skis.</p>
<p>We'd also take the boat out to one of the sandy islands in the middle of the lake. We'd camp out for the night, sleep in a tent, wake up in the morning and cook breakfast, and then we'd just cruise around in the boat. My dad often let me take the wheel—to captain the ship for the afternoon. I'd get badly sunburned, but it was all worth it.</p>
<p>One year, my dad bought a sailing magazine which had plans in it for a simple boat. He got out his woodworking tools, and we used the plans to build a dinghy out of plywood, with a bamboo pole for a mast and a bedsheet for a sail. I taught myself how to sail in that boat. I feel like my dad and I did almost all the projects I could have hoped for. Using our hands to create things, we shared a lot of great hours together.</p>
<p>People have asked if my dad is my hero. I never really thought of him in those terms. To me, he was just a great role model on a lot of fronts, from how he found his own ways to appreciate life, to the honorable way he conducted himself. He was always a perfect gentleman, a man who almost never raised his voice. I don't recall ever hearing him say a disparaging word about anyone.</p>
<p>Of course, looking back, there were sides of his personality that weren't easy to understand at the time. My parents never wanted us to see them fighting, or even having a frank discussion. They would go into the bedroom, close the door, and later come out presenting a united front. They went to great lengths to shield us from any bickering. So I never saw the messy details of how a couple might find agreement. As a young adult, I ended up with an unrealistic expectation that marriages were free of conflict.</p>
<p>There was something else about my father. He'd have days when he'd say he was in a &quot;blue funk.&quot; He didn't fully explain himself, and outwardly, he seemed OK. But I now realize that he suffered from depression, probably for his entire life. In those days, when we thought of the word depression, we thought of the 1930s. The fact that being depressed could be a medical issue didn't occur to a lot of people. And so my father never got help, and just tried to cope with that &quot;funk&quot; on his own.</p>
<p>Sometimes that meant passing out the hammers and building an addition to the house. Sometimes it meant loading up the car and heading down to that roadside motel in Dallas. And sometimes it meant going alone into his room, where he'd deal with demons never discussed with the rest of us.</p>
<p>MY MOTHER was ten years younger than my dad, and especially at first, they had a very traditional marriage. She left college at age twenty-one to marry him, and later regretted not graduating. When I was a teen, she went back to school, majoring in education, and went on to get her master's degree. She taught kindergarten at first, and then spent most of her career as a first-grade teacher at Sam Houston Elementary School in Denison.</p>
<p>It was a great kick to be my mom's son in Denison. People tend to love their first-grade teachers, and my mother was especially kind and nurturing with kids. She was absolutely beloved in town. It's not a stretch to say she was something of a minor local celebrity.</p>
<p>My mother was a terrific pianist, too, and I just loved listening to her play Chopin. When I was in grade school, I'd always say to her, &quot;Will you play more Chopin?&quot; I'm not sure a lot of kids today, plugged into their iPods and cell phones, are calling out to their mothers for more Chopin. But my mother helped instill in me an appreciation of classical music. She was my favorite performer.</p>
<p>I always like to say that my mother gave me three important things: a lifelong love of reading, learning, and music. These are three very special gifts.</p>
<p>I also saw in my mother a commitment to service. She was a leader in a local chapter of the woman's group PEO (Philanthropic Educational Organization). Founded in 1869 in Iowa, its mission was to promote educational opportunities for women. In my mother's day, there were plenty of people who didn't think much of the idea of women going to college, and PEO's platform was somewhat controversial in some circles. And so my mom was very secretive about this PEO &quot;sisterhood.&quot; She wouldn't tell me what they stood for, what they did, what happened at their meetings, or who attended. There was a desire by these women to be quiet about their work. Looking back, I salute them for the work they did to encourage young women to fulfill their potential, but I realize theirs was a form of feminism that hadn't yet found its full-throated voice.</p>
<p>My mother was an advocate for children, too. She believed that young kids could handle more responsibility than adults might imagine. She saw this in her first graders, but she felt it long before she was a teacher.</p>
<p>From the time I was very young, she and my dad impressed upon me the importance of looking after my sister, who was just twenty-one months younger. My father had the traditional sense that men should take care of women. And so he anointed me a kind of &quot;second dad.&quot; But my mother just thought children can rise to the responsibilities they're given.</p>
<p>&quot;When we're not around, we're counting on you,&quot; my mom would tell me. My dad would say, &quot;You're in charge.&quot;</p>
<p>I wasn't always the perfect older brother. When I was five and Mary was three, I once took her out to play in the gravel on Hanna Drive. Some of the stones were smaller than a pea, and I thought it would be fun to feed these tiny stones to my sister. My mom caught me and told me a five-year-old should know better than that. Maybe I did know better, but at that age, feeding gravel to your kid sister doesn't necessarily seem like a bad way to pass the time.</p>
<p>My sister now says that I was a pretty good big brother most of the time. She thinks that looking after her helped me develop the sense of responsibility that has carried me through life, and into my career as a pilot. A couple of times as a teen, she went out with guys who were too forward, or who weren't completely respectful. I took it upon myself to go talk to them and set them straight. My sister feels that even when the two of us were arguing, I was protective and committed to keeping her safe.</p>
<p>We weren't a hugely demonstrative family when it came to showing affection. But we were there for one another, and we felt a sure sense of duty. We also had faith in one another. My mother knew my capabilities and encouraged me to have confidence in them. That's why she was comfortable flying as my passenger when I was a teenager. She knew that I knew I could do it.</p>
<p>My sister also was never afraid to fly with me. &quot;Maybe it's the invincibility of youth,&quot; she now tells me, &quot;and I just figured nothing could happen to me. But I think the main reason I had no fear is because I had an innate confidence in you. I knew you'd protect me.&quot;</p>
<p>I WAS very sure of myself and directed as a kid in the 1960s. I expected to serve in the military and then be a commercial pilot. Looking back, I think I was a very earnest, serious boy still struggling to figure out where I fit in the world.</p>
<p>In one eighth-grade school essay, titled &quot;The Way I Am,&quot; I wrote: &quot;I have good habits as well as bad ones. Being polite is one of my good points. My parents have taught me the manners I should know. I think my table manners are what they should be.</p>
<p>&quot;I have bad habits, too. I am not very patient sometimes with other people. I would like to do everything exactly right, and I would like others to do the same. I should realize that everyone is not perfect.</p>
<p>&quot;I know many people who have better personalities than I do, but I am doing the best I can.&quot;</p>
<p>My teacher wrote at the end of the essay: &quot;You are doing fine.&quot; That's the way things went in those days. Teachers and parents didn't spend a lot of time stroking kids, telling them they were special. Back then, &quot;you are doing fine&quot; was what passed for a compliment.</p>
<p>I see my adult self in that essay. I remain regimented, demanding of myself and others—a perfectionist—though I think that has made me a better pilot.</p>
<p>In another essay, celebrating my family, I wrote about my sister &quot;of whom I am proud, despite her behavior at times.&quot; I wrote of how fortunate I felt to be my mother's son: &quot;She cares for me day and night.&quot; As for my father: &quot;He guides me and teaches me and makes me wiser and more able to profit from my mistakes.&quot;</p>
<p>In the end, it didn't matter that some of the floors in our house were slanted, or that my dad wasn't paying attention to making money. I was supremely lucky to grow up on Hanna Drive, to know where every nail was, and to be nurtured and taught by two people who got so many things right.</p>
<h3 id="5-the-gift-of-girls">5 The Gift of Girls</h3>
<p>I HAVE SEEN breathtaking sunrises and sunsets from the highest altitudes. I have seen the brightest stars and planets from what feels like a front-row seat. But there are things I haven't seen—things that happened down on the ground while I was up in the air, earning a living and appreciating the view.</p>
<p>Being away from home so much, I've missed milestones in my daughters' lives. Many pilots can recite a litany of missed moments. Our children don't wait for us before they take their first steps, say their first words, or need a visit from the tooth fairy. And it's not just early-childhood rites of passage that we're sorry to miss. We also miss nuanced changes in our children's lives as they get older.</p>
<p>Just before Christmas last year, I was off for a few days, and Lorrie and I took our daughters, Kate and Kelly, on a skiing vacation at Lake Tahoe. It was so nice to have this extended time with the girls when they weren't rushing off to school and I wasn't hours away from returning to the airport. It was just a perfect, relaxed vacation.</p>
<p>Tahoe has always held a special place in our hearts. When we take Interstate 80 and cross over the Donner Summit, a part of us feels like we've come home. There's the smell of pine in the air. The sky is clear and crisp. It's just invigorating.</p>
<p>We always try to stay at Northstar, the resort where both Kate and Kelly learned to ski when they were three years old. The resort resembles a European village with cobblestone walkways, and the family programs there are great. We have many wonderful family memories of visits there.</p>
<p>On that particular trip, the first big snowstorm of the season had ended the day before, and the trees were still heavy with fresh snow. Decorated for the holidays, Northstar was covered with little twinkling white lights in the trees. It had a real magical, fairy-tale feel. The lights, the snow, the European village.</p>
<p>Late one afternoon, we had just parked the car, and we decided to do some window-shopping before heading to dinner. It was very cold out, and we were all dressed in heavy jackets, gloves, and hats. We were walking into this valley of buildings, on this cobblestone walkway, when I noticed that the girls, twenty feet ahead of us, were arm in arm and skipping along the sidewalk, Kelly's head on Kate's shoulder. I was so happy to see this, to realize that they had come to a place, here in their early teens, where they could publicly show physical affection for each other. Siblings, of course, are sometimes at odds, and here they were expressing so effortlessly what they meant to each other.</p>
<p>I pointed them out to Lorrie. &quot;Take a look at that,&quot; I said. I thought I was noticing something very special and new.</p>
<p>Lorrie took my arm and smiled. &quot;They've been doing that for five or six months now,&quot; she said. &quot;It's just that you've missed it.&quot;</p>
<p>She said she had frequently seen them walking in the mall, holding hands. She said it was happening very easily and naturally, and she had loved watching it.</p>
<p>I had never fully noticed this. Not until that afternoon. And I felt sadness at the realization of how much of their daily lives I had missed—their activities, their interactions. How could I have missed witnessing these acts of love between my daughters for all these months? Lorrie looked at me sympathetically and saw a sense of loss and remorse in my eyes.</p>
<p>I put my hand over my heart. It's a gesture I sometimes fall back on when the girls do something endearing, or that I feel grateful about. It's a sign between me and Lorrie, a reminder of how lucky we feel about our girls.</p>
<p>I know why it hit me so hard. This was almost like a dream come true. When the girls were very young, one wish Lorrie and I had for them was that they'd be close when they were older. Seeing them together like this was a wonderful realization; I felt like maybe we had done something right. But it was also a painful reminder to me that I am so often not present in my children's lives.</p>
<p>Lorrie says this was one of those &quot;pilot moments&quot;—a pilot comes home and notices a change in his home or family—and seeing my mixed emotions was emotional for her, too.</p>
<p>I took Lorrie's hand, and a few seconds later we made a right-hand turn and came upon a large plaza in the village. Laid out in front of us were twinkling lights. Holiday music was playing and people were ice-skating and roasting marshmallows. There was a large outdoor fire pit. I held tight to Lorrie's hand and enjoyed all of it.</p>
<p>When I go over that day in my mind, I think of the girls, but I also think about Lorrie. I know what a loving mother she is. Yes, I've tried my best to instill values in the girls, to help them find more reasons to care about each other. But Lorrie is on the front line, nurturing them, setting an example, being there for them day and night when I am far away. I marvel at how she has created such a wonderful home life for our family.</p>
<p>I am fortunate to be her husband, and to have her as the mother of my children.</p>
<p>JULY 6, 1936, is a red-letter day for me, and not just because it's the day federal air traffic control began operation under the Bureau of Air Commerce.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm taken with the history, but that day stands out for me on a more personal level. Fifty years later, on July 6, 1986, a fiftieth-anniversary celebration was held at the Oakland Air Route Traffic Control Center in Fremont, California. Organizers invited the public to tour the facility, to see where controllers direct the flow of air traffic over Northern California. Pacific Southwest Airlines agreed to send over a pilot and a flight attendant to talk to the guests, and I was asked to be the pilot on hand.</p>
<p>I had flown a red-eye the night before, as a first officer, so I'd been up a lot of hours and was pretty beat. But I was more than happy to explain how pilots interact with air traffic control.</p>
<p>The flight attendant who had been selected to join me got sick and couldn't come. So PSA sent over a vivacious twenty-seven-year-old from its marketing department, a young woman I had never met before. She told me her name was Lorrie Henry, and I introduced myself.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, I'm Sully Sullenberger.&quot;</p>
<p>I have an uncommon name that she must not have heard clearly, and she never asked me to repeat myself. So that entire day, she didn't know how to address me. She just knew I had a lot of Ss and Ls in my name.</p>
<p>Lorrie will tell you it wasn't love at first sight. Despite my pilot's uniform, I looked tired, and she noticed my eyes were bloodshot and I wasn't freshly shaved. And she kept thinking: What's this guy's name again?</p>
<p>At the time, Lorrie had sworn off dating. She'd had a few relationships she considered unhealthy, and had told herself she was taking a break from men. I was thirty-five years old, had been in a short, childless marriage, and I wasn't exactly looking for long-term love either. But I was taken with Lorrie. She was attractive—tall and elegant, with a great smile—and she seemed smart, too. She was very engaging with all the passersby. Pretty quickly after meeting her, I knew I wanted to ask her out.</p>
<p>For about four hours, we stood next to each other greeting the public beside a large model of a PSA aircraft, the BAe-146. A lot of people who came by wanted to share tales of their most memorable PSA flights.</p>
<p>Lorrie wasn't at all flirtatious toward me, and I also remained professional toward her. But I was waiting for my moment. As the event wound down, I said to her, &quot;Why don't we go get a drink?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's a commissary down the hall,&quot; she told me. &quot;If you're looking for a vending machine, you can find one there.&quot;</p>
<p>She wasn't getting it, but I wasn't giving up just yet. &quot;I meant a cocktail,&quot; I said. &quot;In a bar.&quot;</p>
<p>She looked at me, this weary pilot with a lot of Ss and Ls in his name and a confusing opening line, and I suppose a part of her took pity on me. She agreed to accompany me to a nearby Bennigan's. We had that drink, talked for a bit, and as she’d later admit, there wasn't any wild attraction on her part. She assumed she'd never see me again. But I was interested. I asked for her phone number and she gave me her PSA business card, which had only the 800 number on it for the airline's marketing department.</p>
<p>I tried to be clever. &quot;You must be in great demand,&quot; I said, &quot;if you have your own eight-hundred number.&quot;</p>
<p>She resisted rolling her eyes at me and just smiled, and then she gave me her local phone number. I gave her my card and she finally saw my name spelled out. We made a date for a couple of days later.</p>
<p>By the time Lorrie got home, however, she had decided she wasn't ready to date anyone, and in any case, she wasn't really up for dating me. She called me and left a message on my answering machine that she had to work the night of our date.</p>
<p>Listening to her message, I clearly sensed her lack of interest, and I figured that was that. But days later, Lorrie told a close friend that she had decided not to go out with me. Her friend told her, &quot;No man is going to find you if you're sitting home on the couch.&quot;</p>
<p>Lorrie argued that the couch was just fine for her. She wasn't looking for a man, anyway. Still, her friend's words stayed with her, and a week later, she was surprised to find herself calling me.</p>
<p>When we spoke she admitted that she had been less than truthful when she canceled on me, and that she was nervous making the call. She said she'd like to accept a date with me if I was still interested. Of course, I was.</p>
<p>We lived fifty-five miles apart, but we ended up seeing each other for dinner three Friday nights in a row. After the second dinner, I walked her to her car, leaned toward her, and kissed her. Lorrie thought I was being forward. The way she tells the story now, she was &quot;taken aback a little bit.&quot; But I kissed her for a reason. I wanted her to know that I wanted to kiss her, and that I found her attractive. I'm glad I kissed her. I'd do it again. (In fact, I have.)</p>
<p>That kiss was a turning point, and she began warming up to me, too. For more than a year, we went back and forth between her home in Pleasant Hill and mine in Belmont. Eventually it just felt right to move in together. In early 1988, we settled into my place.</p>
<p>I'll never forget coming home to Lorrie for the first time after being away on a four-day trip. The house was glowing. She had music on, the food on the stove smelled wonderful, and the house was warm and inviting. &quot;If I had known it would be like this,&quot; I told her, “I'd have insisted we move in together sooner.&quot;</p>
<p>Marriage was the obvious next step, and on the morning of our wedding, June 17, 1989, I wrote Lorrie a letter: &quot;I can't wait to marry you. I want you and need you and love you with all my heart.&quot;</p>
<p>I meant every word of that, but it's hard for a groom on his wedding day to fully understand all the challenges of marriage. Lorrie and I would have to learn to face a lot of obstacles together. There were adventures ahead that we never could have predicted.</p>
<p>LORRIE PROVIDES a lot of the color in our lives. She's intuitive, emotional, creative, more at ease with people, and more outgoing. In certain ways, she's more innately optimistic than I am. It can take a lot to get me to smile, but you'll often find Lorrie walking around with a smile on her face for no particular reason. Before Flight 1549 made me recognizable, we'd go to parties and everyone would remember Lorrie. As for me, couples would drive home saying to each other, &quot;I think he said he was an airline pilot.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm analytical, methodical, more of a scientist. I am able to fix things. I'm optimistic if I've reviewed the information and decided that I can make something work. Otherwise, I'm pretty much a realist. Together, Lorrie and I like to say, we become one whole person. So in a lot of respects, we're a good fit.</p>
<p>Of course, our differences also get in the way. &quot;When you're the emotional one, you want your spouse to emote more,&quot; Lorrie says. I do try, but I'm not always good at it. She wants to have detailed discussions about our relationship and our family dynamics. I'm more specific. What are the issues? What steps can I take to correct a problem?</p>
<p>I've asked Lorrie: &quot;If things are going OK, why do we need to talk about them so much?&quot;</p>
<p>I can feel close to Lorrie by touching her hand or giving her a hug. I'm nonverbal. She says it takes more effort than that to have a real relationship—and that means conversation.</p>
<p>I try. But sometimes, by the end of the day, you can feel you've said everything you've wanted to say. I've had to learn that it's important to save something for Lorrie—an anecdote, something I've read, something funny that happened on a trip. Lorrie has discovered that I become a better talker when she gets me out of the house and into the fresh air. When we take a hike or walk together, she says, it's easier to engage me in conversation.</p>
<p>We also try to have regular date nights, and we make a point of dressing up, rather than wearing casual clothes all the time. It's a way of showing respect; we're not taking each other for granted.</p>
<p>Lorrie likes me to make the reservations once in a while so I'm not always leaving it to her to be the social secretary. And when we go out, she wants to have a real dinner conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;Sully is a man of few words,&quot; Lorrie tells her friends. &quot;So I tell him to save up his words for date night.&quot;</p>
<p>LORRIE SAYS that part of what makes me a good pilot is my attention to detail. She has told me: &quot;Sully, you expect a lot from yourself and those around you. You're in control. That helps you as a pilot. But those aren't always good husband qualities. Sometimes I need a companion who is more forgiving and less of a perfectionist.&quot;</p>
<p>I know I can be exasperating to Lorrie. &quot;Sully,&quot; she has said more than once, &quot;life is not a checklist!&quot;</p>
<p>I understand her frustration, but I don't see myself that way. I'm organized. I'm not a robot.</p>
<p>She says that when we go on vacation, I choreograph things with military precision, from loading the trunk to the time of departure. &quot;That makes sense if you're flying a hundred fifty passengers to some vacation destination,&quot; she tells me. &quot;But if you're just packing our suitcases into the car for a family getaway, it's not necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>My response to her: &quot;That's confirmation bias. You find things that confirm your point of view, and you ignore evidence to the contrary.&quot;</p>
<p>In my heart, of course, I know she has a valid point.</p>
<p>In some important ways, my profession as a pilot is easier for me than relationships are. I can control an airplane and make it do what I want it to do. I can learn all of its component systems and understand how they work in every circumstance. Piloting is well defined, with a process that is predictable and understandable to me. Relationships, on the other hand, are more ambiguous. There's a good deal of nuance, and it's not always obvious what the right answer is.</p>
<p>In the twenty years of our marriage, we've had our share of bumps in the road. At certain points, one of us would be working harder at the relationship than the other, and then it would flip-flop. We weren't always equally committed to addressing issues. That has been an impediment at times.</p>
<p>Lorrie describes herself as &quot;the voice raiser, the emotional one.&quot; I'm easily frustrated, often tired from traveling. And the fact that I'm always packing up to leave doesn't help. Marriage counselors advise couples not to go to bed angry. It's also not a good idea to fly across the country angry, leaving an unhappy spouse at home.</p>
<p>&quot;For me, absence does not make the heart grow fonder,&quot; Lorrie says. She stopped working at PSA a long time ago, and has spent most of her energy since then as an at-home mom. She would love to have a husband who comes home every evening. &quot;We could have a glass of wine, eat dinner together, chat about our day,&quot; she says. &quot;And I don't even need the wine or the meal. I just want the husband in the room with me.&quot; She and I have nice phone conversations when I'm on the road. &quot;It's not the same as having you here,&quot; she tells me.</p>
<p>In some ways, it was worse when the kids were younger, because back then Lorrie wanted my hands-on help. For a while we had two in diapers and in car seats, and she felt overwhelmed when I left on a long trip. Sometimes, she'd be in tears as we said our good-byes. In her PSA days, she had once gotten to sit in a flight simulator. &quot;I know the flap settings,&quot; she'd tell me. &quot;I'll get the plane off the ground. You stay home with two crying babies for four days.&quot; She was joking, but...</p>
<p>Now that the kids are older, she says that when I return home after a four- or five-day absence, my reentry to family life isn't always smooth. I'm jet-lagged, I'm out of the loop of family activities. I've missed a lot. Lorrie says it sometimes takes me a day and a half before I can give something back to the relationship. I'm in the house, but I'm not able to jump back into our normal routine with the same vigor. Sometimes I'm just feeling spent, and not eager to attend to household chores.</p>
<p>I do see myself at times as somewhat of an outsider in my own family. But I love that the girls connect so well with Lorrie, and I understand why my bonds with them are not as effortless. I get it: I'm more formal, I'm male, I'm older, I'm gone a lot.</p>
<p>Parents build up a bank account of interactions and memories with their children. Lorrie has had a lot more moments with the kids than I have, so her bank balance with the girls is higher than mine. Certainly, there's a lot of love between me and the girls, but I know I have handicaps that I have to work to overcome.</p>
<p>My time away is a challenge. But Lorrie and I have been through great challenges together, and we have spent twenty years working through them. We work hard to find the right balance. We have both learned a lot about ourselves and each other and about what it takes to make a relationship work and to make it rewarding. We have both grown. By working on this together for each other and for our girls, we have become better people. We have invested in ourselves.</p>
<p>HOW DID my personal life, apart from my aviation experiences, prepare me for that journey to the Hudson? I think that these challenges Lorrie and I faced together made me better able to accept the cards I've been dealt—and to play them with all the resources at my disposal. Early in our marriage, Lorrie and I were dealt the challenge of infertility.</p>
<p>A year or so after we got married, Lorrie and I began planning to have a family. We spent a year trying to conceive, without success, and then went to a fertility specialist. For six months, Lorrie took Clomid to induce ovulation. Like many women on that drug, she gained weight, and that was troubling for her. She'd been in good shape before starting on the medication, and here, for reasons beyond her control, she just kept getting heavier. She put on thirty-five pounds.</p>
<p>One day she and I were in the car and she turned to me and said, &quot;You never make a comment about how I look or about my weight.&quot; My reply came naturally to me—I just said what I felt—but it meant a lot to Lorrie. I told her: &quot;You don't get it, do you? I love you for what's on the inside.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's what every woman wants to hear,&quot; she said, and she meant it.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get things right.</p>
<p>We kept trying to conceive, but I was off on trips a lot, which made it hard for Lorrie and me to connect at the appropriate moment. A couple of times, she flew to the city where I was staying on a layover so we wouldn't &quot;waste&quot; a thirty-day cycle. It wasn't exactly romantic. We were focused and a bit tense. We were on a mission.</p>
<p>The Clomid didn't work, so eventually we turned to in vitro fertilization. The cost was $15,000—not covered by insurance—and we were told the success rate was about 15 percent. Lorrie needed to endure shots at 2 A.M. and 2 P.M., and when I was home, I'd give them to her. When I wasn't home, she gave them to herself.</p>
<p>These were not easy times for Lorrie. &quot;I feel like my body has betrayed me,&quot; she'd say. &quot;My body won't do the one thing it was designed to do, the one thing that separates one gender from the other.&quot; We'd been raising guide dogs for the blind, and a couple of the dogs were pregnant at the time. &quot;It seems like everyone and every animal I meet is pregnant,&quot; Lorrie would tell me. &quot;Everyone except me.&quot; I knew she felt deeply wounded, but I didn't fully know how to help her.</p>
<p>I was the one who had to tell Lorrie that the in vitro effort hadn't worked. She took one look at me and she knew. I had what she later described as a completely flat expression on my face.</p>
<p>I felt devastated for myself, but even more so for Lorrie. All I could say to her was: &quot;Honey, I'm so sorry.&quot; We hugged each other and she cried for a while. I tried to be stoic for her, but I was hurting, too.</p>
<p>We went back to the doctor, who told us we were both still relatively young—I was thirty-nine and Lorrie was thirty-one—and we should consider trying again.</p>
<p>Lorrie had gotten to know another woman who was a patient at the clinic, and on the day Lorrie learned she wasn't pregnant, that woman was thrilled to learn she was. But then, a few days later, the woman was told that actually her pregnancy hadn't taken. It was possibly more devastating to have such high hopes dashed. When Lorrie heard this news, she decided she'd had enough.</p>
<p>&quot;What's our main goal?&quot; she asked me, and then she answered. &quot;Our goal isn't for me to be pregnant. Our goal is to have a family. And there are other ways we can do that.&quot;</p>
<p>Before she met me, Lorrie had been a longtime Big Brothers Big Sisters volunteer. She saw that as both a duty and a labor of love. She began mentoring her &quot;little sister&quot; when she was twenty-six and the girl was five. Now Lorrie is fifty and her little sister, Sara Diskin, is twenty-nine, and they're still close. And so when Lorrie was unable to get pregnant, she was able to frame our predicament very clearly. &quot;I've known for a long time,&quot; she told me, &quot;that the beauty of a relationship is not biology. I'm ready to move on.&quot;</p>
<p>And so we decided we'd adopt.</p>
<p>Trying to adopt a baby was also an arduous journey—a long, difficult, emotional, expensive roller coaster—and we learned a lot about ourselves in the process.</p>
<p>Lorrie vowed to approach the adoption search as a full-time job. It took effort to educate ourselves about a process that was not well defined. There were many avenues. Which ones would pay off? Lorrie tried to have a business plan, but adoptions don't always proceed logically.</p>
<p>The fortunes of adoptive parents vary according to the wishes of birth parents. Their names are buried deep on waiting lists, while their files get dissected at agencies by people who don't really know them. There's no clear order to the process.</p>
<p>Lorrie was very emotional through all of it, and my attempts at a workmanlike approach didn't always help. &quot;You don't know how to console me,&quot; she told me at one point. &quot;It's outside your parameters. You're unable to feel things the way I feel them.&quot;</p>
<p>Lorrie struggled with all the paperwork we had to file, and the fact that we had to &quot;qualify&quot; to be adoptive parents. It was hard for her. Throughout her infertility treatments, she was poked and prodded. She had surrendered her body in an effort to find her way to parenthood. She had shown her commitment. Now she was being asked to find friends who'd vouch for whether or not she could handle being a parent. It felt almost like an insult.</p>
<p>Lorrie and I handled all the paperwork very differently. One day we exchanged our answers to a set of questions. I had to tell Lorrie: &quot;You're overthinking this. Just answer the simple question with a direct answer.&quot; She was grateful when I told her that. It allowed her to temper some of her anxiety about the process. She didn't owe them her life story. She owed them basic answers to their questions.</p>
<p>We met with several sets of birth parents over the months that followed, hoping they'd select us. That was a hard process, too. Lorrie would often be excited after a meeting, certain that we'd get the nod. I tried to be logical and analytical. &quot;Yes, that birth mother said a lot of nice things about us,&quot; I'd tell Lorrie, &quot;but think about what she didn't say.&quot; Lorrie said I was raining on her parade, but I felt we had to look at everything realistically or we'd set ourselves up for wave upon wave of disappointments.</p>
<p>We met with a variety of birth parents during our search. And then, on December 1, 1992, we flew down to San Diego to meet a woman who was seven months pregnant. The birth father was there, too.</p>
<p>The couple asked us about our lives, our dreams for the child we hoped to someday raise, my schedule as a pilot, everything. They were honest and clear-eyed as we spoke, and so were we. Not long after that, we got word: They had selected us to be the adoptive parents.</p>
<p>At 2 A.M. on January 19, 1993, we got a call that the birth mother was in the delivery room, and we should prepare to fly down to San Diego to pick up our new baby. Lorrie was too excited to sleep. As for me, the realist, I knew that I'd be a better father in the morning if I got some sleep. So I went back to bed. Lorrie couldn't believe how I could sleep at a time like this. She stayed up, sitting by the phone, waiting.</p>
<p>Kate was born at 4 A.M., and we flew to San Diego just after sunrise. We brought a car seat with us because we'd need it in the rental car once we picked up the baby. Lorrie and I felt a little self-conscious walking through the airport with that empty car seat. Were people looking at us, wondering where our baby was?</p>
<p>When we arrived at the hospital, we went straight to the nursery and saw Kate for the first time; it was an overwhelming moment. I fell in love with her the second I saw her.</p>
<p>Later, a nurse was holding Kate. &quot;Would the mother like to hold the baby?&quot; the nurse asked. The birth mother pointed to Lorrie and said, &quot;She's the mother.&quot; Lorrie was handed Kate.</p>
<p>Eventually, Lorrie had to use the bathroom, and while she was gone, Kate needed to have her diaper changed. I was proud to be the first of us to get to do that.</p>
<p>Early that afternoon, hospital staffers told us we were free to take Kate and go. Lorrie wanted to say good-bye to the birth mother. &quot;What can you say to a woman who has given you this kind of gift?&quot; she wondered. &quot;I don't think there are any words.&quot;</p>
<p>Both of us considered the birth parents to be incredibly courageous people. They knew that for whatever reason—their age, circumstances, finances—they couldn't raise their child. And so they had made a very hard yet loving choice. They had turned their wrenching dilemma into a gift.</p>
<p>Lorrie left the baby with me in the nursery—she thought it would be too hard for the birth mother to see Kate one last time—and she went into the birth mother's hospital room. As she offered a simple thank-you, she saw a single tear running down the birth mother's face.</p>
<p>&quot;Just be good to her,&quot; the birth mother said.</p>
<p>It was an overwhelming moment for both of them.</p>
<p>Hospital protocol requires new mothers to leave the hospital in a wheelchair. Lorrie tried to explain that she hadn't given birth and didn't need a wheelchair, but the aide with the wheelchair insisted on accompanying us out the front door. And so we walked, holding Kate, as the empty wheelchair was pushed beside us. It was ridiculous and surreal, but it was an amazingly happy moment, too.</p>
<p>In the parking lot, it almost felt as if we had stolen Kate. We looked over our shoulders, wondering if someone would be coming back to get her. We ended up putting her in our car seat, driving a mile from the hospital, and pulling over to the curb.</p>
<p>We looked at each other. We looked at Kate, who looked up at us. I wasn't crying, but it was as emotional a moment as I've ever had in my life. I was a father.</p>
<p>Just fourteen hours after being born, Kate was on her first airplane ride, heading back with us to Northern California. As an aviator, I was certainly happy to get her into the air that quickly.</p>
<p>Two years later, another birth mother looked through thirty-six bios in a book of potential adoptive parents, and after meeting Lorrie and me, agreed to make us parents for the second time. On January 6, 1995, when the call came that the birth mother had gone into labor with Kelly, I was in Pittsburgh, receiving simulator training on the MD-80. I cut short my training and made plans to return home as soon as possible, which was the following morning.</p>
<p>Lorrie, meanwhile, headed to the hospital. For the birth mother, it was a very long labor, and Lorrie stayed up for twenty-four hours straight, just waiting. Unlike when Kate was born, this time Lorrie was in the delivery room, and the whole day had a cinematic feel to it. There was a huge storm outside, with rain coming down in buckets and a howling wind. Then, when Kelly was finally crowning, a nurse gasped and said, “Oh my gosh!”</p>
<p>Lorrie was taken aback. “What, what, what?” she said, her heart pounding.</p>
<p>The nurse answered, &quot;We've got a redhead!&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as Kelly arrived, just after 10 A.M., the doctor handed her to Lorrie, which was an overwhelming moment for her. The rain. The thunder. This new beautiful baby. And I missed it all. While Lorrie was cuddling Kelly in the first seconds of her life, I was above the clouds somewhere over Denver.</p>
<p>I made it to the hospital that afternoon, and seeing Kelly for the first time was another moment of instant love and gratitude. And the most amazing thing was how much Kelly looked like me when I was a baby: the shape of our heads, our eyes, our Irish coloring. I was strawberry blond as a boy. We'd later mount baby photos of me and Kelly side by side in a frame, and it was hard to tell us apart. It's interesting how that goes in an adoption sometimes. Lorrie likes to say that we are blessed to have children who resemble us. It's not that we need the girls to look like us, but it's nice that they do. And over the years, it meant that if we opted not to voluntarily tell various people about the adoptions right away, we didn't have to.</p>
<p>Kelly's adoption was more complicated than Kate's. There are a lot of factors that can slow down the paperwork—or even make it fall through. It's hard for birth mothers to make their decisions final. They often have family pressures to consider.</p>
<p>Lorrie and I had to deal with some of these issues, and we struggled with the uncertainty. We passed the hours at a restaurant called Taxi's, which was near the hospital. We ate lunch and dinner there while we anxiously waited for the paperwork to come through. We were deathly afraid, with time passing, that some bureaucratic snafu could lead other issues to unravel, and keep the adoption from being finalized. At one point, I had a very forceful conversation with the hospital administrator, telling him that the hospital had to get its act together. I was pretty worked up and assertive, but it was necessary to break the logjam.</p>
<p>On the day we brought Kelly home, we had her in a car seat in the back of our car. Two-year-old Kate came out of the house and stared quizzically at this baby. She thought Kelly was a new doll she was getting as a present. She'd soon know better.</p>
<p>Out there at the car, Lorrie and I looked at each other and I said what I was thinking: &quot;We're a real family now.&quot;</p>
<p>As we get deeper into our marriage, Lorrie and I have become big believers in the idea that we should focus on what we have rather than what we don't have. We have weathered some serious storms in our relationship, but on a lot of fronts, we feel closer than ever now. And we really try to live in a way that allows for the word gratitude. In fact, Lorrie has since made a career as an outdoors fitness expert, helping other women stay in shape physically and emotionally. As part of her work, she teaches women about the power of accepting life as it presents itself, and enjoying that life.</p>
<p>Lorrie and I have vowed to appreciate each other, appreciate our two daughters, appreciate every day. We don't always maintain that positive attitude. We still have our arguments. But that's our goal.</p>
<p>And so, yes, I choked up seeing our two teenage daughters arm in arm, skipping down that street at Lake Tahoe. It reminded me of what I've missed, and that was hard for me. But it also reminded me of how lucky we all are to have one another, and why we have a duty to try to live happily together, from a place of gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="6-fast-neat-average">6 Fast, Neat, Average</h3>
<p>WHEN PASSENGERS ARE awaiting takeoff on a commercial plane, I'm guessing that most of them don't give a lot of thought to how the pilots in the cockpit got their jobs. Passengers seem most concerned about when they have to turn off their cell phones, or whether it's still possible to use the restroom before the cabin door is closed. They wonder about making their connecting flights, or being stuck in the middle seat. They're not thinking about the pilot's training or experience. I understand that.</p>
<p>Some passengers boarding Flight 1549 at LaGuardia said they had noticed my gray hair, which they equated with experience. But none of them asked about my résumé, my flight record, or my educational background. And why would they? As they should, they trusted that my airline, US Airways, had rigorously selected its pilots based on federally mandated criteria.</p>
<p>And yet, every pilot has a very personal story of how he or she ended up in control of that type of aircraft and in that particular airline's cockpit. We all had our own unique paths and career progressions, and then found our way to commercial aviation. We don't often talk about all the steps we took, even among ourselves, but every time we pilot a flight, we are bringing with us all of the things we've learned over the thousands of hours and millions of miles we've flown.</p>
<p>Until the mid-1990s, 80 percent of pilots working for major airlines were trained in the military, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Now, just 40 percent of newly hired pilots get their training in the military. The rest come through civilian training programs, including some two hundred universities that offer aviation training. The World War II and Korean veterans—my mentors when I started—retired as commercial pilots more than two decades ago, after turning sixty years old, then the mandatory retirement age. There aren't a great many Vietnam-era pilots left either, even though the retirement age was raised to sixty-five in 2007.</p>
<p>As for myself, I am grateful that I came into aviation through the military. I appreciate the discipline taught to me during my days in the Air Force, and the many hours of intense training I received. In some civilian programs, pilots aren't always taught with the same rigor.</p>
<p>I was tested in so many significant ways during my time in the service that I sometimes look back and wonder: How did I make it through? How did I succeed when some didn't? How was I able to complete every flight, landing my plane safely, when others I knew and respected didn't make it safely to the runway and lost their lives? As I look back, I reflect on the intersections of preparation and circumstance, and that helps me understand.</p>
<p>MY MILITARY career provided many of the important steps along the way. The initiation to my military life began in the spring of 1969, when I was a senior in high school and went to see my congressman, Ray Roberts, at his office in the ranching town of McKinney. Then fifty-six years old, he was a well-regarded Democratic leader in Texas, who six years earlier had been in President Kennedy's motorcade in Dallas. He was four cars behind the presidential limousine when the shots were fired.

I had come to Representative Roberts because in order to attend one of the service academies, I'd need a congressional appointment. In some congressional districts, patronage determined which young people got appointments at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland; the Air Force Academy near Colorado Springs, Colorado; the Military Academy at West Point, New York; the Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York; or the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut.</p>
<p>But Representative Roberts believed his appointments should be merit-based. And so he had ambitious young men like me come to his office to be interviewed by a panel of retired generals and admirals who lived in his district.</p>
<p>After we’d gone to the post office to take a civil service exam and scored well enough on it, we were brought before this ad hoc board of military heavyweights at the congressman’s office. The board he put together had two tasks. First, to determine whether an applicant had what it took to make it at a service academy. Second, to decide which academy an applicant was best suited for. Since my dad didn’t know anyone in high places, I was grateful to have a chance to land an appointment on merit. I had a shot.</p>
<p>I was nervous going to my interview, uncomfortably dressed in my sport coat and tie, but I was excited, too. I’d devoured books about the military and about aviation since I learned how to read. I’d paid attention. So I was prepared when I finally sat down in front of that panel of four senior officers for their very formal twenty-minute proceeding.</p>
<p>The retired Army general seemed to enjoy lobbing questions. “Mr. Sullenberger,” he said, “can you tell me which branch of the service has the most aircraft?”</p>
<p>I assumed most applicants would give the obvious answer: the U.S. Air Force. But I knew this was a trick question. And I had done my homework. I’d studied the specifics of each branch of service and the aircraft they used. “Well, sir,” I said, “if you’re including helicopters in your count, the U.S. Army would have the most aircraft.”</p>
<p>The retired general smiled. I was passing the audition. As we continued talking, he seemed eager to have me go to West Point. But I was pretty straightforward that day. I wanted to fly jets in the Navy or the Air Force, and I didn’t want to go to West Point.</p>
<p>As things turned out, Representative Roberts offered the Air Force Academy appointment to another applicant. He gave me the Naval Academy appointment. Then, as fate would have it, the boy with the Air Force slot declined to take it. And so I moved up from the alternate spot.</p>
<p>I was eighteen years old and bound for Colorado. I would be receiving the full ride of a first-class education. In return, I agreed to pay my country back by serving five years as an active-duty Air Force officer.</p>
<p>I ARRIVED at the Air Force Academy on June 23, 1969, and as a kid from rural Texas, it was an eye-opening moment to meet the other cadets, who hailed from all over the country. Yes, a few of the 1,406 young men in my entering class were wealthy boys from elite families who got there through their fathers’ connections. More were sons of military officers, some from families with long military traditions. But once all of us had made our way through long lines to get our heads shaved, it felt as if those distinctions no longer mattered. It would be the same grueling road for all of us. Only 844 of the 1,406 who arrived that day would end up graduating.</p>
<p>We were welcomed to the academy on a gorgeous Colorado morning when there wasn’t a cloud in the sky. From that day on, I was amazed by the West. You could see for a hundred miles in any direction, and the mountains were right there—a pretty stunning sight for a boy from the flatlands of North Texas.</p>
<p>The academy grounds were architecturally dramatic, and at the time, the buildings were fairly new. The Air Force Academy had been completed just twelve years earlier; the first class graduated in 1959. If I made it through all four years, I’d be in the class of 1973, which would be just the fifteenth graduating class. The first female cadets wouldn’t arrive until 1976, three years after I left.</p>
<p>I was pretty nervous that day. I didn’t know what to expect. Unlike some new cadets, I wasn’t aware of how intense the hazing was going to be. Once we had put away our street clothes and gotten into our drab, olive-green fatigue uniforms, the upperclassmen showed up and started yelling at us.</p>
<p>“Stand up straight! Suck your gut in!”</p>
<p>“Push your chest out! Get those shoulders back and down!”</p>
<p>“Get those elbows in! Get your chin in, mister!”</p>
<p>“Keep those eyeballs caged straight ahead!”</p>
<p>Did it shake me up? Of course it did. At age eighteen, I lacked the life experiences to put it in perspective. I was a kid straight from my comfortable upbringing, and all of a sudden I was thrust into a situation where I didn’t know which way was up. It was disorienting.</p>
<p>It is natural to question the utility of such theatrics. Do I think it was necessary? I’m still not sure. But now as an adult, I do understand some of the rationale for that first-year hazing. It was designed to tear us away from the easy, the comfortable, and the familiar. It was intended to refocus our perspective and reset our priorities. For all of us, it would no longer be about “me” but about “us.” That first year began to make real what, until then, had been theoretical constructs—like duty, honor, and “service before self.” These words could no longer be thought of as abstractions. Instead they now had real meaning in real life, as in “in-your-face” reality. It’s amazing how clearly and how quickly one learns about diligence, responsibility, and accountability when the only allowable, acceptable responses to any query by a superior are “Yes, sir,” “No, sir,” “No excuse, sir,” or “Sir, I do not know.”</p>
<p>The rule was that the upperclassmen weren’t supposed to get physical with us. But there was some jostling along with the yelling and the intimidation.</p>
<p>Those who argue in favor of hazing say that it builds a sense of loyalty among comrades, and there’s some truth to that. As that freshman year wore on, I felt very close to many of my fellow “doolies” (it’s a derivation of the Greek word doulos, which means “slave”). You have volunteered to fight for your country, and you feel that sense of patriotism. I have heard and read the experiences of those who saw combat, and they say when you get to the battlefield, you’re really fighting for your comrades, not some politician or political ideal. You’d rather die than let your comrades down.</p>
<p>My doolie year left me bonded for life with some of my fellow freshmen. It was an intense experience; it wasn’t like just going off to college. We were being tested, abused, physically challenged. And we had to watch a number of those in our ranks fall away. Some wouldn’t make it through the mental and physical challenges of basic training. Some would fail academically, or feel too intimidated by the hazing. Others would transfer to regular universities after deciding, “This is not for me. I want a good education, but not at this cost.” Those of us who endured and remained became a brotherhood.</p>
<p>That first summer we were sequestered at basic training, and it was the most grueling physical experience of my life. We’d have to go out on formation runs, our rifles held high above our heads, our boots slapping the ground at the same instant, and it was a real sign of weakness or failure to drop out of formation. The upperclassmen would yell: “Keep that rifle high! Don’t be a pussy. You’re letting your classmates down!”</p>
<p>The guys who had the most trouble were those who couldn’t run well enough. They’d get used up and have to stop. And once a cadet dropped out of formation, the upperclassmen would circle him and yell at him. It was very intense. Some men would throw up from the exertion. On rare occasions, someone would cry. Some of my classmates had fathers who were military officers; they feared they’d be disowned if they had to drop out of the academy. I felt for them. I would later wonder where they would end up, at a civilian university perhaps—someplace where you could get a good education without going through all of this.</p>
<p>I had grown up at sea level, and here we were, at an elevation of almost seven thousand feet. It was hard for all of us until we acclimated to the altitude. I was usually somewhere in the middle of the pack, but I held my own. I was determined to make it through the summer, and through the four years to follow.</p>
<p>Though I was homesick and exhausted, I did enjoy some aspects of that summer. They would break us into teams and give us physical problem-solving tests to evaluate us. We were handed a bunch of ropes and boards and, as a team, had to come up with a way to get from one side of a large enclosed cubicle to the other without touching the ground or the water below, and in a limited amount of time. The upperclassmen and officers stood there with clipboards and stopwatches, observing who had the leadership skills to get his team safely across. When it was my turn to be the leader of this exercise, I did pretty well, and that gave me confidence.</p>
<p>I know that summer of training helped me later. It made me realize that if I dug deep enough, I could find strength I didn’t know I had. If I hadn’t been forced to push myself that summer, I would never have known the full extent of what inner resources I had to draw upon. It wasn’t as if I was lazy as a boy. I wasn’t. But until that summer, I had never pushed myself to the limit. Those of us who made it through realized that we had achieved more than we thought we could.</p>
<p>WHEN SUMMER was over, the physical demands let up, but the academic demands set in. It was an extensive and difficult core curriculum. No matter your major, you had to take a large number of courses in basic sciences—electrical engineering, thermodynamics, mechanical engineering, chemistry. We also took courses in philosophy, law, and English literature. In retrospect, I am grateful for the education, but at the time, the course load felt staggering.</p>
<p>Luckily, for those of us who so badly wanted to fly, there were just enough perks to keep us motivated.</p>
<p>My first ride in a military jet was during freshman year, in a Lockheed T-33, which dated back to the late 1940s. The plane had a bubble canopy and went about five hundred miles an hour. It was typical of jets from that era; the aerodynamic technology had outpaced the propulsion technology. It was well into the 1950s before jet engines were designed to produce enough thrust to fully take advantage of the strides in aerodynamics.</p>
<p>So this old T-33 was underpowered. Still, it was an incredible thrill to be in it.</p>
<p>Each new cadet was taken for a forty-five-minute ride, and the purpose was to give us an incentive to work hard so we wouldn’t drop out of the academy.</p>
<p>This was the first time I’d ever worn a parachute, helmet, and oxygen mask, the first time I had ever been seated on an ejection seat. The officer piloting the plane did a roll, then headed ten miles west of Colorado Springs and flew over Pikes Peak upside down. My stomach was rock solid through all of it. I was so engaged in the moment. I was just eating it all up. I knew that, no matter what, this was what I wanted to do with my life.</p>
<p>When the forty-five minutes were up, of course, it was back to reality. The hazing awaited us on the ground.</p>
<p>We ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner in Mitchell Hall, sitting at rectangular tables of ten. Each table had a mix of freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. We freshmen had to sit rigidly at attention, our backs straight, our eyes only on our plates. We had to lift our forks to our mouths in a robotic fashion, and we were not allowed to look beyond the food in front of us. We weren’t allowed to talk to one another. Only when an upperclassman addressed us, asking us a question, could we speak. They would spend mealtime quizzing us, and we had to shout out our answers.</p>
<p>We each had been given a book called Checkpoints, a pocket-size bound volume. We had to memorize all of this legendary lore, and especially the Code of Conduct. When upperclassmen asked us questions, there’d be hell to pay if we didn’t know the exact answers.</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct, established by President Eisenhower in 1955, was considered vital because during the Korean War, American POWs had been forced through torture to collaborate. The term in those days was that they’d been “brainwashed.” And so the military came up with specific rules of conduct, and we were expected to memorize them all. As future officers, for instance, we had to vow: “I will never surrender the members of my command while they still have means to resist.” We could surrender only in the face of “certain death.” We had to repeat key lines from the code: “If I am captured I will continue to resist by all means available. I will make every effort to escape and aid others to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy.”</p>
<p>Mealtime became increasingly stressful because the upperclassmen were relentless in their demands. We had to memorize the details about a great number of airplanes. We were expected to know foreign policy, American and world history, and sports scores from the day before. We had to be able to rattle off the full names of all the upperclassmen at the table, including their middle initials, and their hometowns. Now, forty years later, many of those names and middle initials remain seared into my head. I remember the hometowns, too.</p>
<p>The degree of harassment awaiting you at mealtime depended on your daily table assignment. Walking into the dining hall, if you saw you were seated with a kindhearted senior, you were relieved. But if one of the seniors sitting at your table was a notorious hard-ass, your heart would sink. You knew dinner would be excruciating.</p>
<p>In that case, you hoped for one of two things: Either another freshman cadet at your table would be so pathetically hopeless at memorization that the upperclassmen would focus on him, which meant they’d leave you alone and you could eat. Or else you hoped that one of your freshman tablemates was a genius or had a photographic memory—someone who got everything right. When upperclassmen came upon a know-it-all, they’d focus all their energies on stumping him, finding the one question he couldn’t answer, and then giving him hell for his wrong response. When that happened, the rest of us were ignored and got to eat.</p>
<p>THERE WAS one upperclassman, a year older than I was, who wasn’t vindictive about his hazing. But he knew exactly how to make his point.</p>
<p>One day, we were getting ready to march to the noon meal. It was a warm morning and we were in short sleeves. I was standing at attention, and he came up to me, asking if I thought I’d done a good job polishing my black uniform shoes.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” I said.</p>
<p>“How confident are you?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Sir, I am very confident,” I answered. (I wasn’t allowed to say: “I’m very confident.” I had to say “I am.” Freshmen were prohibited from using contractions.)</p>
<p>This upperclassman decided to make this into a challenge. “Are you willing to match shines?” he asked. My shoes versus his.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>He defined our rules of engagement: “If you are confident that you have a better shine than I do, and it turns out you are right, then I will make your bed tomorrow. If my shoes have a better shine, then you’ll make my bed as well as your own.”</p>
<p>All of us, including the upperclassmen, had to make our own beds using hospital corners. We had to pull our sheets and blankets tight enough so they wouldn’t show any wrinkles. The test was to drop a quarter on the bed. If the quarter didn’t bounce, we’d have to pull off all the bedding and start again. It was no fun. So if this upperclassman made my bed the next day, it would be wonderful.</p>
<p>He gave me permission to stop looking straight ahead, and to look down at my shoes and then at his. Our shoes seemed equally shiny. But I chose to be bold. “Sir, I win,” I told him.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s pretty close,” he responded, “but we’re not finished yet. Let’s compare the soles of our shoes.”</p>
<p>He stood on one foot, allowing me to see his instep, the arched middle section between the heel and the ball of the shoe. The leather on each of his insteps had been polished to a sheen. My insteps, of course, were not. He was like a good trial lawyer who never asks a question without knowing the answer. He had set me up.</p>
<p>“Sir, you win,” I said. He saw my lips turn into the hint of a grin, and even though doolies weren’t allowed to smile while in formation, he cut me some slack by not calling me on it.</p>
<p>There were plenty of other times I had to stifle my smile.</p>
<p>While marching in basic training, we were required to take turns counting off in cadence: “Left, left . . . left, right, left . . .”</p>
<p>Early on in my life, I noticed that accomplished people on TV, especially newscasters such as NBC veterans Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, enunciated perfectly and seemed to have no real accents. I tried to sound more like them, and less like some of the people in my town, who had thick Texas accents. So when it was my job to count off in cadence, I don’t think the other cadets could hear Texas in my voice.</p>
<p>But there was one fellow doolie, Dave, who came from West Texas—and you knew it every time he opened his mouth. Whenever he led us, he would count off in cadence: “Lay-uff, lay-uff . . . lay-uff, raah-yut, lay-uff . . .”</p>
<p>I’d chuckle inside, but my face remained expressionless as we marched around. “Lay-uff, lay-uff . . . lay-uff, raah-yut, lay-uff . . .”</p>
<p>We were truly a melting pot at the academy, and sometimes it felt like the clichéd casting in a World War II movie. We had the guy with a Polish name from Chicago, the Texan, the Jewish kid from one of the boroughs in New York, a guy from Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>It’s funny, the things you remember.</p>
<p>When my daughter Kate entered high school in the fall of 2007, Lorrie and I went to back-to-school night, and her math teacher looked familiar to me. As he spoke, it hit me: He was two years ahead of me at the Air Force Academy. He had been one of the upperclassmen asking me mealtime questions my freshman year. So after his presentation, I walked up to him and said: “Fast, neat, average, friendly, good, good.” He looked at my face and he had a flash of recognition, too. He knew exactly what I was saying.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of every meal, freshmen at the end of each table had the additional duty of filling out Air Force Academy Form 0-96—the critique of the meal. It was another useless ritual. By tradition, we always filled out the form the same way. How was the service? “Fast.” What was the appearance of the waiter? “Neat.” How was the portion size? “Average.” What was the attitude of dining-room personnel? “Friendly.” How was the beverage? “Good.” And the meal? “Good.”</p>
<p>Kate’s math teacher and I shook hands and smiled, two older men recalling the rhythmic, long-ago language of our youth.</p>
<p>IN MAY of 1970, near the end of the freshman academic year, the hazing stopped, and we had what was called “The Recognition Ceremony,” formally acknowledging our new status as upperclassmen. That was the day we no longer had to address the older cadets as “sir.” We could eat in relative peace. Eventually, when it was my turn to quiz freshmen during meals, I asked questions about flying, as opposed to barking out demands for mindless memorization. I was more comfortable making it educational for the younger guys.</p>
<p>Despite all the regimentation, there was also a sense that your superiors and professors tacitly condoned unauthorized schemes that showed spirit or initiative. Every year, tradition dictated that the freshman class had to assert itself in some way, to prove itself worthy by coming up with antics that equaled or surpassed the stunts tried by previous freshman classes.</p>
<p>Our class seized on the idea of redecorating the outside of the planetarium, where cadets gathered to study astronomy. The large domed building was white like an igloo, but one day well after taps, my classmates sneaked out in the dark of night and covered the building in black plastic, sticking a number eight on the center of the dome. When the entire academy gathered for the march to breakfast, it looked like a huge eight ball. I wasn’t involved in the stunt, but I felt a nice charge that day. That and a few other stunts definitely helped our morale.</p>
<p>In the summer before sophomore year, we all endured survival training. We were each sent into the woods for four days without food and water. This was called SERE training, which stood for “survival, evasion, resistance, and escape.” It was designed to teach us survival skills, how to avoid being taken as prisoners of war, and how to behave if captured.</p>
<p>The upperclassmen dressed up like communist soldiers and came looking for us. The drama was a bit over-the-top, but it all felt like serious business. I struggled during those days, overwhelmed at times by lack of sleep and food. I was luckier than some of my classmates, because I managed to sneak into the upperclassmen’s encampment unnoticed and grab a loaf of bread and some jelly. Others went all those days without eating.</p>
<p>By sophomore year, I realized how much all of these experiences had helped me mature. I had been very homesick in my first six months at the academy. But when I returned home for visits, my homesickness ended. Here I was, not yet out of my teens, but I had met people from all over the world. I had done hard things I didn’t know I could do. It was as if I had become a man, and my hometown seemed so much smaller to me than I had remembered.</p>
<p>We hadn’t been allowed to fly an aircraft at the academy until the end of our doolie year, so when I got back to Mr. Cook’s grass strip on breaks, I was pretty rusty. I didn’t have enough flying time to really have the total mind-muscle connection that one has riding a bike. I had to get my bearings again.</p>
<p>Starting in my sophomore year at the academy, I got an amazing amount of flying instruction and experience. I’d get a ride down to the airfield every chance I could.</p>
<p>I also signed up to learn how to fly gliders. I loved flying the gliders because gliding is the purest form of flight. It’s almost birdlike. There’s no engine, it’s much quieter, and you’re operating at a slower speed, maybe sixty miles an hour. You feel every gust of wind, and so you’re aware of how light your airplane is, and how you are at the mercy of the elements.</p>
<p>Gliding in Colorado, I learned that the way to stay aloft longer is to carefully use the environment to your advantage. The sun heats the surface of the earth unevenly, especially in summer, and so some parts become warmer than others. The air above the warmer parts is heated and becomes less dense, so you have rising air over these areas of the earth. When you fly through a column of rising air, you can feel it lifting the airplane. If you enter a very tight turn to remain in that air, it’s like riding an elevator as long and as high as it will take you. It’s called “thermal lift,” and going from one thermal to another, you can end up soaring for hours.</p>
<p>In the wintertime, you have “mountain wave lift.” The winds in the air are stronger in winter, and if the wind is crossing a mountain or ridgeline, it’s like water flowing over a rock. If you stay in the rising air above the mountain, you can remain aloft for long periods.</p>
<p>While I was at the academy, in addition to all the hours spent in gliders, I got my flight instructor certificate. I began to teach other cadets, including a dozen friends, how to fly both airplanes and gliders.</p>
<p>Because I had so much experience, when I graduated from the academy in 1973, I was named “Outstanding Cadet in Airmanship.” It was an honor that came because I’d been tenacious in honing my skills through all those hours in the skies.</p>
<p>THE AIR Force Academy gave me an education on many fronts—about human nature, about what it means to be a well-rounded person, and about working harder than I’d thought possible. On campus, the education we received was called “The Whole Man Concept,” because our superiors weren’t just teaching us about the military. They wanted us to have great strength of character, to be informed about all sorts of matters we might easily dismiss, and to find ways to make vital contributions to the world beyond the academy. We cadets often dismissed it as “The Manhole Concept,” but in our hearts we knew we were held to high standards and difficult tests that would serve us well.</p>
<p>It seemed almost as if the goal was to prepare each cadet to be chief of staff for the Air Force. Only one of my classmates, Norton Schwartz, actually made it; he was appointed to the highest-ranking Air Force job in August 2008. But many of the rest of us did OK, too, in our own way, graduating into the world beyond the academy with a full set of skills and a high sense of duty.</p>
<p>Fast, neat, average, friendly, good, good.</p>
