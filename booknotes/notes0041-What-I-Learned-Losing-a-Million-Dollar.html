<h2 id="the-trader">The Trader</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The symbol of all relationships among such men, the moral symbol of respect for human beings, is the trader. We, who live by values, not by loot, are traders, both in manner and spirit. A trader is a man who earns what he gets, and does not give or take the undeserved. A trader does not ask to be paid for his failures, he does not ask to be loved for his flaws. A trader does not squander his body as fodder, or his soul as alms. Just as he does not give his work except in trade for material values, so he does not give the values of his spirit -- his love, his friendship, his esteem -- except in payment and in trade for human virtue, in payment for his own selfish pleasure, which he receives from men he can respect. The mystic parasites who have, throughout the ages, reviled the trader and held him in contempt, while honoring the beggars and the looters, have known the secret motive of their sneers: a trader is the entity they dread-- a man of justice.</p>

<h3 id="foreword">Foreword</h3>
<p>I received a copy of <em>What I Learned Losing A Million Dollars</em> in the mail along with a letter from the authors inquiring if I would be willing to preview and comment on the book. I must admit, since I didn't know the authors, I didn't plan on reading the entire book. But the title intrigued me, so I took the book with me on vacation and began reading it on the airplane. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.</p>
<p>While the book is particularly instructive for new entrants to the securities markets, there are lessons for the seasoned pro as well. The authors draw terrific analogies between gambling and investing and what most people do in both to cause their downfall. I am a money manager and in my thirty years in the investment business I have often noted the blurred line between the two activities. My father taught me when I was very young not to gamble against the odds. If investors or speculators in the securities business could learn the same lesson they would be much more successful.</p>
<p>This requires doing your homework and developing a plan ahead of time. Most people don't have any idea what they will do if their investments go up or down just as they don't know how they will react if their gamble wins or loses. The key is to make rational decisions ahead of time on how you will react -- win or lose. That way you won't wind up making the awful emotional decisions which take place after the market moves. Remember, no one plans to fail, they just fail to plan.</p>
<p>I believe all different styles of investing can be successful. Momentum investors, growth investors, value investors will all be more successful if a non-emotional plan is utilized with discipline. Those who read and understand this book will have a major advantage in the investment game; they will be able to invest unemotionally while almost all other investors and speculators are driven by their emotions.</p>

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
<p>Books can generally be categorized into one of three groups: education, entertainment or reference. Education books teach us, entertainment books amuse us and reference books inform us. This book combines education with entertainment to make it easier to recall the lessons by remembering the story. In that sense, this book is a parable: a simple story illustrating important lessons. From the story of the little boy who cried wolf to the story of the emperor's new clothes, parables have been used to convey lessons that apply to many aspects of life. Similarly, in this book the story is about a commodities trader but its lessons apply to stock market and bond market investors, as well as all types of business people: entrepreneurs, managers and CEOs.</p>
<p>The moral of the story you are about to read is: Success can be built upon repeated failures when the failures aren't taken personally; likewise, failure can be built upon repeated successes when the successes are taken personally. Thomas Edison failed roughly 10,000 times before finding the right filament to make an electric light bulb. The day his Menlo Park laboratory burned to the ground a reporter asked him what he was going to do. Edison responded, &quot;Start rebuilding tomorrow.&quot; In part, Edison succeeded because he didn't take failures or losses personally. On the other hand, consider Henry Ford who worked with and greatly admired Edison. Ford started in 1905 with nothing and in fifteen years had built the largest and most profitable manufacturing firm on the planet. Yet a few years later this seemingly impregnable business empire was in shambles and would go on to lose money almost every year for the next two decades. Ford was known to stick uncompromisingly to his opinions; is it possible his company lost so much money because he took the successes personally and came to think he could do no wrong?</p>
<p>Personalizing successes sets people up for disastrous failure. They begin to treat the successes totally as a personal reflection of their abilities rather than the result of capitalizing on a good opportunity, being at the right place at the right time, or even being just plain lucky. They think their mere involvement in an undertaking guarantees success.</p>
<p>This phenomenon has been called many things: hubris, overconfidence, arrogance. But the way in which successes become personalized and the processes that precipitate the subsequent failure have never been clearly spelled out. That is what we have set out to do. This book is a case study of the classic tale of countless entrepreneurs: the risk taker who sees an opportunity, the idea that clicks, the intoxicating growth, the errors and the collapse. Our case is that of a trader, but as with all case studies and parables the lessons can be applied to a great many other situations. These lessons will help you whether you are in the markets or in business. The two areas have more in common than one might suppose. Warren Buffettt, the richest man in America, is quoted on the cover of Forbes 1993 edition of the 400 Richest People in America: &quot;I am a better investor because I am a businessman, and I'm a better businessman because I'm an investor.&quot; If the elements of success can be transferred between the markets and business, the elements of failure can too.</p>
<p>We could study a hypothetical series of successes to demonstrate how success becomes personalized and then how a loss follows, but you are more likely to remember and learn the lessons if they are presented in anecdotes about a real person and a really big loss. How big? The collapse of a fifteen-year career and the loss of over million dollars in a mere seventy-five days.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-why-a-book-on-losing">Introduction: Why a Book on Losing?</h3>
<p>Almost without exception, anyone who has participated in markets has made some money. Apparently people have at least some knowledge about making money in the markets. However, since most people have lost more money than they have made, it is equally apparent that they lack knowledge about not losing money. When they do lose, they buy books and attend seminars in search of a new method of how to make money since that last method was &quot;obviously defective.&quot; They are like racing fans making the same losing bet on an instant replay. Investors' book shelves are filled with Horatio Alger stories of rags to riches millionaires. Sometimes these books are read solely for entertainment, but more often than not they are read in an attempt to learn the secret of how the millionaires made their fortunes, particularly when those millions were made by trading in the markets. Most of these books are of the &quot;how-to&quot; genre, from James Brisbin's 1881 classic <em>The Beef Bonanza: How To Get Rich On The Plains</em> to modern day versions of how to get rich in the market: <em>How to win in the market..., How to use what you already know to make..., How to apply the winning strategies..., How to make a million dollars in the market before breakfast.</em> We've all read them, but if the &quot;how-to&quot; books were that beneficial we'd all be rich.</p>
<p>A review of the investment and trading literature reveals very little written about losing money. When something has been written on this topic, it's usually a sensationalistic unauthorized tell-all biography or tabloid-like expose' which panders to people who delight in the misfortune of others. Personality journalism books are definitely read for entertainment, not as an attempt to learn from the subject's mistakes. Losing has received only superficial coverage in most books on the markets; they raise the subject, stress its importance and then leave it dangling.</p>
<p><em>What I Learned Losing A Million Dollars</em> is a light treatise on the psychology of losing and is intended for investors, speculators, traders, brokers and money managers who have either lost money or would like to protect against losing what they've made. Most discussions of the psychological aspects of the markets focus on behavioral psychology or psychoanalysis (i.e., sublimation, regression, suppression, anger, self punishment). This isn't to say such books aren't instructive; it's just that most people find it hard to digest and apply the information presented in those books. Other books use hypothetical character sketches to make their points while others simply compile a list of old saws about losses. This book, on the other hand, entertains and educates you on the psychology of market losses in layman's terms, anecdotally, through the story of a trader who actually lost over a million dollars in the market.</p>
<p>The first part of the book is Jim Paul's personal odyssey of an unbroken string of successes which took him from dirt poor country boy to jet-setting-millionaire and member of The Executive Committee at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, before a devastating $1.6 million loss brought him crashing down. One of the premises of this book is that the rise sets up the fall; the winning sets up the losing. You can't really be set up for disaster without having it preceded by success. If you go into a situation in a neutral position having neither successes nor failures beforehand, you acknowledge that your odds are maybe fifty-fifty; you may have a winner, you may have loser. But if you start from scratch and have a run of successes, you are setting yourself up for the coming failure, because the successes lead to a variety of psychological distortions. This is particularly true if you have unknowingly broken the rules of the game and won anyway. Once that happens to you, you think that you are somehow special and exempt from following the rules.</p>
<p>The seeds of Jim's disaster were sown with his first job at the age of nine. His exposure to the outside world, money, and material things was the foundation for his career's sharp and quick ascent as well as its ultimate collapse. Repeated attempts to make the money back by speculating in the markets ended in failure and left Jim disillusioned. He set out on a quest to find out how the pros made money in the markets so he could follow their example. When you're sick you want to consult the best doctors, when you're in trouble you want the best lawyers, so Jim read all about the techniques of the professionals to learn their secret of making money. But this search left him even more disillusioned since he discovered that the masters not only made money in widely varying ways, but also in ways that contradicted each other. What one market pro advocated, another ardently opposed. It finally occurred to him that studying losses, losing and how not to lose was more important than studying how to make money.</p>
<p>The second part of the book presents the lessons Jim learned from his losing experience. Namely, there are as many ways to make money in the markets as there are people participating in the markets, but there are relatively few ways to lose money in the markets. People lose money in the markets either because of errors in their analysis or because of psychological factors which prevent the application of the analysis. Most of the losses are due to the latter. All analytical methods have some validity and make allowances for the times when they won't work. But psychological factors can keep you in a losing position and also cause you to abandon one method for another when the first one produces a losing position.</p>
<p>The third part of the book shows you how to avoid the losses due to psychological factors. Trading and investment mistakes are well known and easily understood but difficult to correct. What you need is not a long litany of complex psychological theories but a simple framework to help you understand, accept, and thereby avoid catastrophic losses. This book will help you recognize, identify, and avoid the pitfalls of investing, trading, and speculating.</p>
<p>So, why a book on losing? Because, there are as many ways to make money in the markets as there are participants but relatively few ways to lose, and despite all the books on how to make money in the markets, most of us aren't rich!</p>

<p>&quot;Experience is the worst teacher. It gives the test before giving the lesson.&quot;</p>

<p><em>I made $248,000. In one day, a quarter of a million dollars. The high was unbelievable. It's literally like you expect God to call up any minute and ask if it's okay to let the sun come up tomorrow morning.</em></p>
<p><em>I had a special desk that was a copper pedestal coming out from the floor, and on top of it was a giant 3' x 6' x 7&quot; piece of mahogany. The tabletop looked like it was suspended in mid-air. The credenza was a matching piece of wood bolted to the wall, also looking like it was suspended in mid-air. When you walked into the office all you could see was carpet stretching out in front of you, a copper column rising up from the carpet and two pieces of wood levitating in mid-air, defying gravity. And that is just what I thought I was doing: defying gravity. I sat down at my desk on the edge of my chair waiting for the market to open, ready to have another $50,000 day and thinking life didn't get any better than this. I was right. It didn't.</em></p>
<p><em>The market opened down that morning and never traded higher than it did on that last Friday in August. It started down that Monday and I proceeded to lose on average about $20,000 to $25,000 a day, every day for months. The decline was relentless, with only occasional spasms to the upside. Fortunately, I started getting the clients out of the market. Most of the clients got out with some profit, some with small losses. Naturally, I didn't get out. I was in for the long pull. This was going to be The Big Trade. Kirby and I were going to make $10 million on this trade.</em></p>
<p><em>By the middle of October I was under water. I didn't know how Jar under I was, but I knew I'd lost most of my money. As the position got increasingly worse, I began to get margin calls. I'd wait a few days to see if the market rallied so I wouldn't have to meet the margin call. If it did, fine. If it didn't, I'd spend the next couple of days trying to borrow money from my friends. I'd be on margin call for 2 or 3 days at a time but the brokerage firm's attitude was: &quot;We know you're a big wheel. You're on the Board of Governors of the Exchange. You're on the Executive Committee. You're an officer of your firm, etc. We know you're good for the money. &quot;</em></p>
<p><em>The first week in November, I was under water big time: $200,000 or $300,000. I didn't even know how much it was. Bean oil had gone from 36 or 37 cents a pound down to 25 cents. So from the high in August, I was down $700,000 or $800,000. To make matters worse, I'd borrowed about $400,000 from my friends.</em></p>
<p><em>The firm finally, and mercifully, pulled the plug on me because I couldn't. On November 17th one of the senior managers from the brokerage firm came into my office and proceeded to liquidate all my positions.</em></p>
<p><em>I went from having everything on August 26th to nothing on November 17th. However, I didn't intend to give up on trading. I viewed it like blackjack in the caddy pen: I wasn't going to quit playing, but I was going to quit losing.</em></p>
<p>I didn't lose that kind of money simply because of a faulty method of analysis. That may have played a role, but something else was going on to keep me in a losing position even to the point where I went into debt to hold onto it. That something was the psychological distortion accompanying a series of successes, drawing my ego into the market position and setting me up for the disastrous loss.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the Preface, these same distortions afflicted Henry Ford and contributed to his company's downfall in the 1920s and 1930s. And these distortions continue to afflict businesses, managers and CEOs today. For example, in 1993, management guru Peter F. Drucker wrote in The Wall Street Journal that, &quot;The past few years have seen the downfall of one once-dominant business after another: General Motors, Sears and IBM, to name just a few...&quot; and that &quot;IBM's downfall was paradoxically caused by unique success.&quot; Drucker has also said, &quot;Success always obsoletes the behavior that achieved it.&quot; While some of the factors contributing to these downfalls were a function of the particular strategies the firms employed (Drucker called them The Five Deadly Business Sins), there were other factors that were a function individual managers' decisionmaking. This book explores the latter factors.</p>
<p>Personalizing successes sets people up for disastrous failure. They begin to treat the success as a personal reflection rather than the result of capitalizing on a good opportunity, being at the right place at the right time or even being just plain lucky. People begin to think their mere involvement in the undertaking guarantees success. Apparently, this is a common phenomenon. Listen to An Wang, founder of Wang Laboratories: &quot;I find it somewhat surprising that so many talented people derail themselves one way or another during their lives ... all too often a meteoric rise triggers a precipitous fall. People fail for the most part because they shoot themselves in the foot. If you go for a long time without shooting yourself in the foot, other people start calling you a genius?&quot; Listen to Herb Kelleher, CEO of Southwest Airlines: &quot;I think the easiest way to lose success is to become convinced that you are successful.&quot; This &quot;becoming convinced&quot; is the process of personalizing achievements or successes. Learning to recognize and prevent that process is what this book is all about.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, my father told me there are two kinds of people in the world: smart people and wise people. Smart people learn from their mistakes and wise people learn from somebody else's mistakes. Anyone reading this book has a wonderful opportunity to become wise, because I am now very, very smart. I learned a lot from the mistakes that led to a million and a half dollar loss in the market. But there is more to the story than the fantastic fall from the pinnacle of millionaire trader and member of the Executive Committee at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. There is the almost fantasy-like ascent to the top that set the stage for the collapse.</p>
<h2 id="1-from-hunger">1 From Hunger</h2>
<p>I got my first job when I was nine years old. One of my classmates was a caddy at a local country club near Elsmere, Kentucky. One day he asked me if I wanted to be a caddy too, and I said, &quot;Sure.&quot; My parents thought it was a good idea since it would teach me the value of a dollar. I thought it was a great idea, since I would get to keep the dollars.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of my love affair with money. As a result of working at the country club, I learned just how important money really was. It enabled people to have the nicer things in life, most of which I hadn't even known existed. My father was only making $4,000 or $5,000 a year as a surveyor back in the early 1950s, so we couldn't afford the nicer things in life.</p>
<p>Summit Hills was not a very fancy country club, but it was a country club and the people there had a lot more money than the people near where I lived did. So, at the age of nine I became one of the only kids in my class at St. Henry's who knew that &quot;Oldsmobiles are better.&quot; I used to caddy for Charlie Robkey. He didn't play golf very well, but he made a lot of money and had a beautiful car. Charlie would show up in his new Cadillac Eldorado convertible with the top down and his good-looking blonde wife who had on a chiffon scarf sitting next to him. I would say to myself, &quot;Self, I like what Charlie's got, and I think I want to do what Charlie's doing. I don't want to drive a Chevrolet like my folks. I'd like to have an Eldorado like Charlie.&quot; I didn't even know what Charlie did for a living, and it didn't matter. Charlie made a lot of money and had many of the nicer things in life.</p>
<h3 id="goose-nickels">Goose Nickels</h3>
<p>As far as I could see, it wasn't what you did for a living that was important in life; it was how much you got paid for doing it. This idea was driven home not only by the members of the country club like Charlie Robkey, but also by the other caddies. We all admired a guy by the name of Goose -- Old Goose. He was about fourteen or fifteen, and that's old to a nine-year-old. We had a big area called the caddy pen where all the caddies would sit around waiting to go out on a round. We used to pitch nickels against a wall, and Goose was very good at pitching nickels. He could get those nickels to stop up against the wall almost every time. So while I was toting these big golf bags around for four hours to make two dollars, Goose was up there in the caddy pen pitching nickels. At the end of the day, Goose had more money than I did. I worked harder than Goose, but Goose had more money. He had the respect and admiration of everybody in the caddy pen -- not because he could pitch nickels better than everyone else, but because he had a lot of nickels. Making money became important to me; whether I made it by slow honest industry carrying golf bags, or by quick strokes pitching nickels. It wasn't what you did; it was how much you made.</p>
<h3 id="no-little-league">No Little League</h3>
<p>This view of the importance of money was also reinforced by my parents. They not only wanted me to learn the value of a dollar, but they wanted me to have a job and start making that dollar. Some of my friends from school were trying out for the little league baseball team and, naturally, I wanted to try out, too. When we got to the field, the coach asked each of us what position we wanted to try out for. I said, &quot;Shortstop.&quot; I didn't know what a shortstop was or did, but it was the only position I'd heard my friends talk about. Besides, I was short and thought the name sounded neat. That was a mistake; every ball hit to me either rolled between my legs, glanced off my glove or bounced off my head. But I could hit the ball. I hit many of the pitches over the outfielders' heads. Then I hit one directly at the coach who was pitching. I made the team ... playing left field.</p>
<p>At our first game I hit a grand slam home run to win the game 4 to 2. My expert fielding was responsible for the other team's two runs, as well as for getting my uniform dirty. Well, the uniform was a problem because I hadn't told my parents that I had gone out for tryouts and made the team. When I showed up at home that afternoon with a dirty baseball uniform for my mother to clean, I was told I had to quit. &quot;Baseball isn't practical; caddying is. You make money caddying, not playing baseball.&quot; Thus ended my short-lived but illustrious baseball career, reinforcing my view that money was important.</p>
<p>So it was through my exposure to the country club and the caddy pen that I first learned about money and something about making it. I also learned that it was possible to make money playing blackjack, poker and gin. By the time I was ten, I was playing nickel blackjack. Since money was important to me, I was very upset when I almost always lost at blackjack in the caddy pen. I was whining to Goose about it one day, and he told me that I was losing because he and the other guys were cheating. He showed me how he burned the first card on the deck, placing it face up on the bottom so that you couldn't tell the difference between the top and the bottom of the deck. He would pick up the old hands and place them on bottom, but rotate the deck as he needed the known cards on the bottom. I didn't stop playing blackjack, but I did stop losing.</p>
<p>After being exposed to this money-culture at the country club, I wanted to get involved in what the people who had the money were involved in. I wanted to know the right people. So I ingratiated myself with the right people, like Johnny Meyer. Johnny Meyer was the club champion. I became Johnny's personal caddy, which is how I got out of Elsmere, Kentucky the first time in my life. I went to Big Springs Country Club with Johnny in his big Chrysler convertible. He took me to Louisville to be his caddy when he played in the Kentucky State Amateur Championships. We drove from Cincinnati down to Louisville, and at thirteen years old I just thought that was the neatest thing in the world. I was in this cool car with this neat guy who was a great golfer, and I was going to a country club in another city. He was taking me because I was such a good caddy. It was only a seventy mile trip, but for me that was a long way.</p>
<p>My involvement with the country club set changed my perspective on the world and society. If I hadn't been involved, I never would have known about the nicer things in life. Where I grew up in Elsmere, if you weren't exposed to this &quot;other life,&quot; you'd have never known it existed. It's the old situation where Joe Lunch Box is the happiest guy in the world. Joe Lunch Box is the guy who graduates from high school and gets a job at the local factory. He goes to work, tightens the four nuts on the left side of a V-8 engine, eats his lunch, tightens the four nuts on the left side of another V-8 engine, goes home, watches TV and has a beer. He's happy because he doesn't know that Eldorados are neat, that chiffon scarves on the girl in the seat next to you are neat and that McGregor golf clubs with the gold faces are the best and Spaulding Executives are second class. You want McGregor clubs with the gold faces. If you weren't exposed to this &quot;other life,&quot; you didn't know it existed and you didn't know you were missing it.</p>
<p>The country club exposed me to the better things in life, and I wanted the better things. Well, that was a problem because once I learned about this &quot;other life&quot; and that it was better, I also knew that I was missing it. I was at a disadvantage to most of my peers, because I wanted more than they even knew existed. I wanted to learn how to play golf. I wanted to be one of the guys caddies would come up to and say, &quot;Good morning, Mr. Paul,&quot; just like I had to say, &quot;Good morning, Mr. Robkey.&quot; I wanted to become one of these country club guys, not one of those Joe Lunch Box guys.</p>
<p>Basically, what I learned at the country club was: it's not what you do for a living that's important. What's important is how much you get paid for doing it. I could work hard like Joe Lunch Box or I could work smart like Charlie Robkey.</p>
<p>While I believed it was true that what you got paid was more important that what you did, it was also true that certain high paying jobs required some higher education. Joe Lunch Box only went through high school, whereas the Charlie Robkeys and the Johnny Meyers of the world went to college. I realized that in order for me to make serious money, I was going to have to get some kind of education. In order to get a reasonable education, I was going to have to pay for it. I needed money to get an education. To make money I had to have some money, so I always had some kind of job since I was nine years old. I was one of the few guys in St. Henry's High paying my way through school. It was a parochial school and I had to go because my parents were strict Catholics, and they said I had to go. But my folks didn't have enough money to pay the tab, so I paid for tuition, books and clothes. This reinforced my sense of how important money was.</p>
<p>I caddied until I was about fifteen. During that time I also worked in the pro shop and gave golf lessons. After I stopped caddying, I ran a golf-driving range for a while. Next I worked in a restaurant busing tables, and then I worked in a service station My senior year of high school I worked fifty-five hours a week in the service station. I'd get out of school at 2 p.m. and work from 3-11 p.m. five days a week and then eight to ten hours a day on Saturday and Sunday. My folks were very lenient about curfew the whole time I was growing up. I could spend my money and do whatever I wanted because I was working so hard. They really let me do whatever I wanted as long as I didn't get in trouble. My dad's attitude was: &quot;If you screw up and get in trouble boy, I'm gonna ....&quot; My parents laid the ground rules and I followed them.</p>
<p>Once you know what the rules are, it's easy; just follow the rules and win. Once I figured out what it took to get from point A to point B, I did the bare minimum of what it took to get the job done. I drove my teachers crazy because I did well at what I liked, and I did poorly at what I didn't like. All you needed to pass was Cs, so most of the time I got Cs. I did just what it took to get by -- unless I was interested. If I liked the course, I'd get an A. Every report card I ever received had the same comment: &quot;Does not work to potential.&quot; I really drove my teachers crazy. And to top it off, I was elected president of the student council. I was not the type of person the teachers thought should be president. They wanted one of their pet student types who didn't drink, drive fast or otherwise screw around.</p>
<p>I had a lot of freedom since I had my own job, my own money and my own car. I bought a '53 Mercury on my sixteenth birthday with my own money: $700 cash. Man, was it neat! A year later I sold it and bought a '56 Chevy, which was even neater. It wasn't an Eldorado, but it was neat. At seventeen years old in Elsmere, Kentucky, one of the biggest things in your life was your car -- and did I ever have a car. I had the '56 Chevy lowered and shaved. I don't know if anybody will remember what shaved is, but that's when you take the emblems, the trim and the hood ornament off the car, fill the holes with lead, and then repaint it. Then you lower it. I put a big V-8 engine in it and a Hurst speed shift in the floor. This '56 Chevy was hot! It was dark metallic blue with rolled and pleated leather seats and special carpet on the floor. So by the time I was seventeen, I thought I was well on my way to becoming &quot;Mr. Paul&quot; at the country club. I was working and making money, and I had a cool car with a pretty girlfriend in the seat next to me. Look out Mr. Robkey, here I come!</p>
<h2 id="2-to-the-real-world">2 To the Real World</h2>
<p>I sold the '56 Chevy to pay for college. Neither of my parents had been to college so it was sort of a big deal to them that I was going. I used the money from the car and my savings account to pay my way through college. The whole time I had been working, my parents had forced me to put 10% of whatever I made in a savings account which they controlled.</p>
<p>I was accepted to the University of Kentucky in 1961. At the time, state law mandated that if you graduated from a Kentucky accredited high school, you would be accepted to UK. The hard part was staying in once you got there. Since they didn't have room for every Kentucky high school graduate, they tried to flunk out as many students as possible in the first two semesters. The flunk out course was freshman English. Early in my first semester someone explained that this was &quot;the game&quot; and I made sure they didn't flunk me out of school. I couldn't afford to fail, because the only way I was going to get into a country club as &quot;Mr. Paul&quot; was to graduate from college. So I studied my tail off and made a B in freshman English. I finished the semester with a 2.6 grade-point-average. All you needed to stay was a 2.0, and I made sure I stayed. Having survived that first crucial semester, I turned my attention to social life.</p>
<h3 id="frat-life">Frat Life</h3>
<p>Boy, was I in for a surprise when I tried to make it on the social scene. Everybody around me had more money than I did. They also all had Bass Weejuns. I didn't even know what a Bass Weejun was-- it's a style of shoe. Everybody in Lexington wore Bass Weejuns. I had no money, no good clothes and no Bass Weejuns. I didn't even have a suit. I bought my first suit when I was a senior in college, and my buddy Tommy Kron had to lend me the money to buy that. My folks were sending me $10 a week out of my &quot;10%-of-everything-bank-account,&quot; and that was my spending money. When I left Elsmere, I was a pretty big wheel; I had a neat car, I was dating the head cheerleader, I was President of the student council and so on. I had some status as a hometown boy, but when I got down to Kentucky as a freshman, I was from hunger again.</p>
<p>I was just another freshman in Kincaid Hall; a nobody. Socially, there is nothing more pitiful than a freshman boy in college. You are totally worthless. The freshman girls are all looking at the sophomore and junior guys, so the freshman boys just hang around with each other drinking beer and telling stories about how good it used to be in high school.</p>
<p>After six months of this, I decided that if I were in a fraternity things would pick up. So I went out for fraternity rush, which for me was a little bold since I had no good clothes, no upper-class friends and no money. My roommate was a guy named Jim Hersha. His background was similar to mine and, since misery loves company, we went through rush together. The first rush party we went to was at the Sigma Nu house. These people were nuts. They were the <em>Animal House</em> chapter. I swear to God, everything in that movie could have happened at Sigma Nu. When I was a junior, the alumni built them a huge beautiful new fraternity house. To get into the house when they had their big house warming party, you had to throw a brick through one of the windows. Hersha and I decided that the Sigma Nus were a little too crazy, even for us.</p>
<p>We went to a few more parties before deciding that we were going to join the Kappas Sigs. Little did we know that we weren't supposed to be the ones deciding. This is how green I was: I walked down to the hall phone in Kincaid Hall, called the Kappa Sig house and literally asked for the president of the chapter, Herschel Robinson. Herschel got on the phone, and I said, &quot;Herschel? This is Jim Paul.&quot; Now Herschel Robinson didn't know Jim Paul or Jim Hersha from Adam's off ox. &quot;My buddy Jim Hersha and I are going through rush and, frankly, we're a little tired of going to all these parties -- the Delts, the Sigma Nus, the Sig Eps, the SAEs. We've kind of had it. We'd like to come over to the house and pick up our pledge pins.&quot; We went over to the house and, unbelievably, they gave us pledge pins. Now that I know how it is supposed to work, I can't believe we got away with that. We had the chutzpah to invite ourselves to be Kappa Sigs instead of them inviting us. We simply didn't know any better. We were breaking the rules and didn't even know it.</p>
<h3 id="is-gin-a-drink-or-a-card-game">Is Gin a Drink or a Card Game?</h3>
<p>When you join a fraternity, they make you do goofy stuff. It's a rite of passage thing. They make you shine shoes, clean windows, take out the garbage; just nickel and dime harassment stuff. One day I was at the house sitting on the floor shining shoes and two actives, Johnny Cox and Pat Greer, were playing gin. In the middle of one of their games, Greer had to go somewhere. Johnny Cox looked
over and said,<br>
&quot;Hey, pledge. Do you know anything about gin?&quot;<br>
&quot;I know that if you drink as much of it as I did last night, your head hurts the next day.&quot;<br>
&quot;No, you idiot. The card game. Do you know how to play gin?&quot;<br>
&quot;No sir, I don't. But I've always wanted to learn.&quot;</p>
<p>Now remember, I learned how to play cards at Summit Hills Country Club when I was ten years old. I'd been playing gin for eight years.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, stop that shoe shining shit and come over here.&quot;</p>
<p>So, I went over to the table and he said, &quot;All right, we're going to play gin. And understand, pledge, that you play gin for money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes sir, I understand that. But I don't have any money. I mean I really don't have any money.&quot;</p>
<p>The truth of the matter was, I didn't have any money. But I also wasn't that worried that I didn't have any money.</p>
<p>Cox said, &quot;I understand that. I understand. We'll make it very, very cheap. You still have to play for money, but we won't play for any real money. We'll only play for 5 cents a point.&quot;</p>
<p>If you don't know anything about playing gin, you wouldn't know that 5 cents a point is real money. A nickel a point, $1 a box, $5 a game, means you're probably playing somewhere in the neighborhood of $10 to $15 a game. That isn't cheap. A game to 150 points might take 10 hands, 15 hands tops. Somebody's going to get to 150 about every 20 or 30 minutes. So, now you're playing at a rate of about $30 an hour. Now that is <em>real money</em>.</p>
<p>Cox explained the rules and told me how the score is kept and so on. Then he dealt out the cards. I would gin, and I'd ask, ''I'm sorry sir, I've forgotten. What do I do again when I don't have a discard? When they all match?&quot; And he'd go crazy. &quot;Just lay 'em down pledge. Okay. Okay. You win.&quot; He really didn't think I knew a thing about what was going on.</p>
<p>We played for seventeen hours before he said, &quot;That's it! I quit!&quot; I won $612, which in 1962 was a whole lot of money. Tuition was $81 a semester, so $612 was big money. He didn't have $612 but he gave me $50 and owed me the rest. For the remainder of my pledge-year I didn't have to shine any more shoes, clean garbage cans or anything. He'd get other pledges to shine the shoes, and then I would credit him 25 cents a pair. Whenever the other actives wanted me to do something, I'd say, &quot;Fine, write it down. Johnny, I'm supposed to clean the garbage cans. What do you think that's worth? Two dollars? Okay, fine, subtract two dollars.&quot; Somebody else would have to do the garbage cans and I'd sit in there and play gin with Cox. That was another lesson in working smart instead of working hard.</p>
<p>Not having to do any more grunt work as a pledge sort of set me apart from the other pledges. I was also beginning to think of myself as a little different from most people; I succeeded at just about anything I did. I had followed the rules of the game in freshman English and succeeded. Then I had unknowingly broken the rules for entering a fraternity but still succeeded. I was a little different.</p>
<h3 id="very-little-class">Very Little Class</h3>
<p>I was beginning to think of myself as a little better than other people. I had a whole semester when I didn't even buy a book and rarely went to class. I'd get up around 10 a.m. and go to The Grille in the Student Union building. That's where everybody went between classes. I'd sit and socialize, play hearts (another card game), talk to the women, make dates and read The Kentucky Colonel, the school newspaper.</p>
<p>We not only met girls and made dates at The Grille, some of us met our wives-to-be there. I broke the rules and still succeeded in that arena, too. When I met Pat, I was dating two other girls, Sandra and Debbie, on a regular basis. I had just finished reading <em>Tortilla Flat</em> by John Steinbeck. The main character in the book is a guy named Danny. He and his friends are poor and lived up in the hills outside of Monterey, California. One of the themes of the book is that people can rationalize anything. For example, when a friend comes into some money, Danny steals it and rationalizes that he's actually doing the friend a favor by stealing it. &quot;If I don't take the money away from my friend, he is going to use it to buy some wine, get drunk and maybe even burn his house down. It's just awful that he has this money. To be his friend, I need to steal the money from him and save him from himself.&quot;</p>
<p>I liked this book so much that I bought three more copies and gave one to Pat, one to Sandra and one to Debbie. That was a mistake -- a big mistake. Even though they were in different sororities, they used to meet in The Grille with a few other girls and have lunch. And one fateful day, all three girls were sitting there with the same damn book: &quot;Gee, it's interesting you're reading that book.&quot; &quot;Yeah, the guy I'm going with gave it to me.&quot; &quot;Oh, really?&quot; &quot;Me, too.&quot; &quot;Me, too.&quot; &quot; Who might that be?&quot; Little did I know that when it came to dealing with women, you shouldn't use the same modus operandi if you are going to go out with more than one of them at the same time. Why? Because women talk to each other, and if they find out you're treating each of them the same way, none will feel special and all of them will dump you. Luckily for me, Pat didn't dump me.</p>
<p>I just had this knack for doing things the &quot;wrong&quot; way but still succeeding. My first fraternity roommate was a guy by the name of Jim Dillon. He skipped a lot of classes too, but he flunked out. Almost anybody who ran around with me flunked out. Hersha flunked out. Dillon flunked out. Dirken flunked out. A lot of people flunked out. But I didn't flunk out. This just reinforced my view that I was a little different and somehow a little better than everyone else. A few other guys tried to live with Dillon and me, but nobody could handle it. The reason they couldn't live with us is that we didn't do what students are supposed to do: go to school. We'd stay up all night, drink beer and talk. After we took our dates home we'd get back to the room around 11 p.m. and then we'd sit and talk and drink beer until early in the morning. Well, you can't really stay up until 3 a.m. and make an 8 a.m. class. So we didn't go to class very often.</p>
<p>Teachers don't like it when you don't go to class. And if you don't ever go, sooner or later you're going to have a problem. The first semester I lived in the fraternity house I ended up making every grade Kentucky had: A, B, C, D, E (E was an F at Kentucky), W (withdraw) and I (incomplete). I got them all.</p>
<p>Even though I rarely went to economics class, I made an A in the course. I understood it. The professor would talk about marginal propensity to consume and I'd say to myself, &quot;I get it. That's a concept I can understand.&quot; I could look at those supply and demand curves and say, &quot;Yeah, okay, I understand that. That makes sense. Okay, we're going to move supply here... yep, price will go down... yep, I understand.&quot; I didn't even own an economics book. I literally borrowed a book the night before the economics final, sat down and read the whole book for the first time. I went in and made an A because I understood it. I can remember taking the test thinking, &quot;Okay, that question... he's talking about marginal. .. I can see it... okay, the chart looks like this ... it's on the left side of the page ... it should be somewhere around page 250 and what does it say?&quot; I could remember exactly where it was, what it looked like and what it said, and then I just wrote it down. I'm not claiming to have a photographic memory, but for that class I did. The professor hated it because I rarely went to class and I always made As on his tests. It really ticked him off. I wasn't doing what I was supposed to be doing, but I still did well in school.</p>
<p>I made the B in History and the C, D and E in I can't remember what, and I made the W in Philosophy. W is withdraw from the class with no grade and it's beautiful because you don't get a bad grade. It's like you didn't even sign up for the course. God only knows why I signed up for Philosophy. I hated it! It made no sense to me at all. It was all left field stuff: &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot; Who cares? It was like baseball to me: not very practical, so I had no problem withdrawing from Philosophy.</p>
<h3 id="a-glimpse-of-the-futures">A Glimpse of the Future(s)</h3>
<p>My incomplete course that semester was statistics. Although I liked the professor, Dr. Christian, I didn't like statistics; it was too hard. One day Doc Christian called me and said, &quot;There's a friend of mine over here that you need to meet. I think you'd like what he does for a living. You're suited for this game.&quot; The old friend was Horace &quot;Jack&quot; Salmon, a UK graduate and the sales manager of a regional commodity futures specialty brokerage firm in Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
<p>I didn't expect to know what he was talking about. I didn't know futures from past participles, but I respected Dr. Christian and thought, &quot;Who knows? Maybe I'll like what Jack Salmon does for a living.&quot; So I went over to Christian's office to meet Salmon. Jack sat there and talked about soybean prices going up and going down, weather, Japan, acreage, yields, the excitement of the markets and how you either make a lot of money or you lose a lot. The money thing got my attention.</p>
<p>&quot;You can make money doing this?&quot;<br>
&quot;You can make a lot of money.&quot;</p>
<p>Oops! That's what I wanted to do: make a lot of money. When people asked me what I was going to do when I got out of school, my answer was, &quot;Make a lot of money.&quot; &quot;Well, what are you going to do?&quot; ''I'm going to be in business.&quot; I didn't know how I was going to do it. I never thought about what I was going to do; it wasn't what you did for a living, it was how much you got paid for it.</p>
<h3 id="out-of-school">Out of School</h3>
<p>I finally graduated in August 1965. Yes, August. I had to go to summer school to pass second semester freshman accounting. I hated accounting. Accounting to me was &quot;find the missing nickel&quot; bullshit. My attitude was: &quot;I don't care where the nickel is. Pay someone to find it. Better yet, I'll give you a nickel. Just stop asking me to find the one that's missing.&quot; In August 1965 the war in Southeast Asia was rolling. I had signed up for ROTC in 1961 when I was a freshman and Vietnam was just starting. I figured that if it grew, I'd rather go as an officer than as a grunt. I had tried grunt and didn't like it. Officer was better. Officer was like a member of the country club; grunt was the guy who carried the bag. I knew I'd rather be the one telling the guy where to put the mortar than the guy carrying the mortar, so I signed up for Air Force ROTC. Then a friend told me that I could always go to Officer's Candidate School (OCS) once I had my college degree. Why should I do four years of this Mickey Mouse ROTC stuff when I could do six months of OCS later, and only if I had to? So I quit ROTC. That was a mistake -- big mistake. True, OCS was only six months but there were four more months of intensive training before you got in. And those ten months made ROTC look like a picnic.</p>
<p>After graduation I went on a couple of interviews but couldn't get a job offer. I was so 1-A nobody would hire me. (1-A was the draft board's term for being prime draft material.) It was obvious the only job offer I was going to get was to serve my country. There was nothing wrong with me; I wasn't flat-footed, I had 20I 20 vision and I wasn't married. The draft was in full force and this was after the lottery so they were taking everybody. If you were 1-A, you were going -- unless you came up with something really tricky.</p>
<p>Since I couldn't get a real job, I had to move back in with my parents and try to get a part time job while I dealt with getting into OCS. I went down to The White Horse, a very nice dinner club where I had worked when I was in high school. I introduced myself to the owner, which was kind of audacious for a former bus boy. But, once again, I didn't know any better. I said to the owner, &quot;Okay, here's my problem. I'm going to go into the military sooner or later, but in the meantime I'd like a job. I don't want to be a bus boy. I'm 22 years old and a college graduate, so I don't want to be a bus boy. I really don't want to be a waiter either. I think I'd like to be a bartender.&quot; To my surprise he said, &quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
<p>I promise you, there is another society out there in America that is asleep right now. This society is made up of the &quot;night people.&quot; It's people who work as waiters, waitresses and all the other people that serve the entertainment and restaurant industry. They don't live in the daytime; they live at night. Within the night people's society, a bartender is very high on the totem pole. It's the same as being a doctor or a lawyer with day people. With night people, the head bartender at the right restaurant is right up there near the top. Within the night people's society, the head bartender at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York is a dude. All the waitresses, waiters and bus boys think he's neat. The only guy cooler than the head bartender is the maitre d'. So if you're the number two bartender, you're not far off the top. This was like being a Charlie Robkey among the night people. All of a sudden I found myself, at the ripe old age of twenty-two, very high up in the night people's society. I had thirty-year old waitresses who thought I was cute, and when they found out that I was going away to war, &quot;Ohhhhhh.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="youre-in-the-army-now">You're in the Army Now</h3>
<p>Meanwhile I was having a problem getting into OCS, and the draft board was closing in. Why the problem? Well, because I had two misdemeanors on my record, both of which were related to spring breaks in Florida. One misdemeanor was for using a hotel's wooden deck chairs as firewood for a bonfire on the beach in Daytona. (It seemed like a good idea at the time.) The other was for breaking into an outdoor display case in Ft. Lauderdale to try to steal a mounted sailfish to take back to the frat house. (I can't even recall if that seemed like a good idea at the time.)</p>
<p>So, when I tried to get into OCS and a question on the application form asked: &quot;Have you ever been arrested?&quot; I had to put &quot;Yes.&quot; To get into OCS, I had to go to Washington. My father knew a federal judge and Pat's father was best friends with a congressman from Tennessee. So I went to Washington and met with the judge and the congressman. The federal judge was nice to put on the application, but it was the congressman who got the job done. This is when I learned that having hooks works. Knowing the right person to get something done will get it done. He said to me, &quot;You sure you don't want to be in the Navy? The Navy owes me big. I could do the Navy real easy.&quot; (The deal was: in the Army's college option OCS when you graduated and got commissioned, you only had to serve two years. The Navy was three; the Air Force was four. I was very interested in doing this in as short a time as possible.) I said, &quot;No sir, I really want to be in the Army.&quot; The congressman just picked up the phone, called the Army and bingo -- I got in the Army OCS. Now that's what I call having hooks.</p>
<p>Basic training and OCS are a lot like the pledge games in the fraternity. They test you by giving you things to do in impossibly short time frames. They do it to see what happens to you when you get stressed out. That's the game: &quot;Let's give this guy an impossible situation and see what happens.&quot; It's like weeding out students with freshman English. If you don't know it's a game and how to play it, you will stress out. Their game plan is to get as many people as possible to quit in as short a time as possible. If you're focusing on this thing like it's really serious, then the training is very stressful. If you're focusing on it like: &quot;This is a game and all these clowns are doing is trying to drive me crazy,&quot; it isn't hard. I had no problem with it. It was difficult in the sense that it was physically demanding, but it wasn't hard psychologically. I knew it was a game, and I understood their rules and their motivation.</p>
<p>The top 20% in the class were invited to stay at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland to be instructors for the new Ordinance OCS Program. Being an instructor is a great way to learn public speaking, because you're in front of a bunch of officer candidates who have to be there and you outrank them. You don't have to be worried that they're going be unhappy with the job you're doing. You're the Lieutenant, and they're the candidates. You're in total control. So if they make one wrong move, you shoot them. Since then I've spoken to audiences of fifty or more people over a hundred times and I love it.</p>
<p>After I graduated from OCS and became an OCS instructor, I had to go through Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) school. The first day of MOS school, a general came in and talked about the course. Then he said that at the end of the course they would recognize an Honor Graduate based on the highest academic standing and the highest this and the highest that.</p>
<p>I went home that night and said to Pat (we were married by then), &quot;This is it! Everybody has been giving me this B.S. all my life that I don't do what I ought to do and I don't work to potential. All right, I tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna be the damn Honor Graduate. I'm gonna be that man. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do whatever it takes to be that guy.&quot; At the end of the course I was the Honor Graduate. I couldn't believe it! I had done it and it wasn't even that hard! All I did was figure out what the rules of the game were and then followed them.</p>
<p>Naturally, I had accepted the Army's offer to be an instructor at Aberdeen. It was great! I became well known within the ranks as being a very good instructor. I was good at it. It's very easy to be an instructor when you say the same thing every week, and they change the people you're saying it to. There's a lot of stuff I can't do, like math and statistics. But when He was passing out talents, He said, &quot;And this one gets the gift of gab.&quot;</p>
<p>I was the first Lieutenant at Aberdeen to become a Master Instructor. It was just another game to me. You had to do a bunch of B.S., and I did it. It wasn't hard. Every other Master Instructor had been at least a Captain and most were Majors or Lieutenant Colonels. I was only a 2nd Lieutenant; the lowest ranking officer there is.</p>
<p>The Master Instructor title, OCS training and the MOS Honor Graduate were the same deal: &quot;It's a game. They wrote these rules; I understand these rules. I can follow these rules and win the game. It's no big deal. It isn't hard.&quot; Some of it was aggravating but I didn't take it personally. There was nothing personal about it. They didn't know I existed when they wrote the rules, so it was totally impersonal. You can either play the system or you can let the system play you. Pick one. I like playing the system because it's more fun and you win more. If you let the system play you, you can get very frustrated and very beat up.</p>
<p>After thirteen months at Aberdeen, I received orders sending me to South Korea. My record was starting to build. I'd just gotten the medal for the job I did as an instructor and the Master Instructor honor. The Army is very big on that stuff, so I got promoted to 1st Lieutenant. They made me the Adjutant, the guy in charge of personnel, for a battalion. I was the S-1 of the battalion at Camp Humphries, Korea. It was all paper work. I had to sign everything. I hated paper work but I did it. I also did the rest of my job with a little more flair than my predecessors. I came up with ideas and new ways of doing things. I become noticed. I was not very good at being invisible.</p>
<p>One day I got a call from the XO (the number two man) of the brigade, the unit above the battalion. He wanted to meet me for lunch. I cleared it with my boss (the military is very big on chain of command stuff) and met him for lunch. He offered me the job of S-3, which was the Operations Officer of the brigade. Now understand that this was the equivalent of number three man in the brigade. The organizational chart is: the brigade commander, then the brigade XO, then the S-3. I was about five steps away from that S-3 position as the Adjutant of the battalion, so this guy wanted to multipromote me five steps. The S-3 was usually a Lieutenant Colonel and I was only a 1st Lieutenant! Realistically, I should have to go through Captain, then Major, then Lieutenant Colonel before I'd even be considered for this job. I became S-3 of the brigade at the ripe old age of 23. I had about as much business being an S-3 as I did being a goalie on the Hartford Whalers. I didn't have any idea what I was doing. I was in way over my head; six-footthree in ten feet of water.</p>
<p>One of the missions of this brigade was 8th Army nuclear weapons storage. I had a side arm -- Top Secret this, Top Secret that. &quot;Aye yi yi. I'm 23 years old! What am I doing? Are these people nuts? I don't need this responsibility. Jesus Christ! This is scary. My only claim to fame is that I was a Master Instructor back in Aberdeen, and that was easy. Two years ago I was burning hotel deck chairs for a bonfire on a beach in Daytona, Florida, and now I'm sitting on World War III! I'm nervous about this!&quot; Someone else should have been doing this nuclear weapons thing.</p>
<p>Since Vietnam was heating up so much during the 1960s, Korea was kind of in the background -- until the Pueblo incident. In 1968 the North Koreans captured the intelligence ship U.S.S. Pueblo in international waters. The world would have been real scared if it had known that I had the position I had during the Pueblo affair.</p>
<p>My experience in the military reinforced my view that it really was money that was important in life, not what you did to make it. In the military it's the other way around. Your job is more important than money. Sure, I was S-3 as a 1st Lieutenant instead of a Lieutenant Colonel, but I wasn't getting a Lieutenant Colonel's pay. I was only too happy to return to the real world again where money was what counted.</p>
<p>My mother had gotten me into Xavier University in Cincinnati on probation as a student in their MBA program. I was on probation because I only had a 2.2 grade-point-average coming out of undergraduate school. Pat and I moved to Cincinnati and got an apartment. She started teaching and I started school.</p>
<p>Because of my experiences in the Army and especially because of what I had proved to myself by being the Honor Graduate, I wanted to do well in school this time around. I decided As were better than Cs. Fortunately, most of the classes I was taking were easy for me: marketing and economics, and no statistics or math. I don't like math. I can do arithmetic as well as anybody, but arithmetic and math aren't the same thing. I don't like formulas. If you put an x and a y on a page I go, &quot;I don't care! Hire somebody to do that.&quot;</p>
<p>I cruised through the first semester classes. Most of the other people in the program were General Electric engineers coming back to school to get their MBAs. There was a big GE plant outside Cincinnati in Evandale, and these guys were all either chemical or electrical engineers. They all carried slide rules on their belts (this was during the dark ages before hand-held calculators), but most couldn't spell marketing or economics.</p>
<p>Then we had to take a course called Quantitative Business Methods. It was a math course. The first day of class, this geek math teacher (who was a total math teacher: dull, dry and two slide rules on his belt) started out by saying, &quot;To pass this class you will need a working knowledge of calculus.&quot; Oops! I hadn't taken calculus. I wasn't going to take calculus. I couldn't spell calculus. But I had to have this course to graduate. I sat through the first few classes, but I didn't understand any of it. All these geeks I'd been laughing at in all these other courses were doing fine. They understood everything he was talking about. They had their little slide rules out arguing over the third place decimal to the answer, and I couldn't even get the right handle. I studied for two days for the first test and still only made a 38; the lowest grade in the class -- by a lot.</p>
<p>So I called a buddy of mine I had gone to high school with who majored in math at Notre Dame. &quot;Ralph, I need a tutor. I mean, I'm in deep, deep shit here. I'll pay you. I've got to pass this course. I don't know what I'm doing. I need somebody who can talk to me and make sense out of this stuff.&quot; He agreed to help me. The game was: I didn't care if I knew any of it. He just had to get me to where I could pass this course. I studied my tail off. I still didn't know any of it, but I did pull a C in the course.</p>
<p>The point was: I was laughing at all those guys in all the other classes because they couldn't carry my jock strap in economics and marketing, and all of a sudden I couldn't carry their jock straps in math. That taught me that there are people for places, places for people. You can do some things and you can't do other things. Don't get all upset about the things you can't do. If you can't do something, pay someone else who can and don't worry about it.</p>

<p>Since my grand plan was to &quot;go into business&quot; and &quot;make a lot of money,&quot; becoming a stockbroker seemed like the perfect job. It's really just a well respected sales job, but if you're good at it the pay is super. I decided to get acquainted with some prospective employers for when I finished the MBA. I went down to &quot;the street&quot; in Cincinnati, and I started going to all the brokerage offices: Bache, DuPont, Hornblower -- some of the names don't even exist anymore. I was looking for a part time job that would accommodate my school schedule. The deal I wanted was this: &quot;I can work part time 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. I don't care what I do. I don't care what I get paid; if I get paid. But when I finish graduate school, I want to go into your training program and become a registered broker.&quot; At most of the big firms I was a round peg in their square hole; they wanted full time or nothing. One major wire house was the exception.</p>
<p>I walked into this office on just the right day in 1968. One of the biggest brokers in the office was primarily a commodities broker, and I happened to walk in the day after his assistant had quit. This broker was producing $300,000 to $500,000 a year in gross commissions -- in commodities-- in 1968! He was a big hitter.</p>
<p>The office manager's secretary said, &quot;You'll have to talk to the office manager, Mr. Fitzgerald.&quot; I went in to talk to Larry Fitzgerald and he said, &quot;What do you know about commodities?&quot; I didn't know anything, but I remembered a few of the buzz words from the meeting I had with with Jack Salmon and Dr. Christian in college. I said, &quot;I've always been interested in futures. I'm particularly interested in the soybeans… and meal… and oil. Trying to figure out how the weather is going to affect the crop.&quot; I used the buzz words I had heard Salmon use. Fitzgerald said, &quot;Okay, you're hired -- if Cohan wants you. Go out and meet Ed Cohan.&quot; Cohan was the big commodities broker. Fitzgerald introduced me to him and after a very short interview Cohan said, &quot;Okay, you're hired.&quot;</p>
<p>On my way out of the office, Fitzgerald's secretary told me to come back the next day to fill out an application and take a test. &quot;Test? What kind of test?&quot; I asked. She said it was called the Minnesota Study of Values Test. Without knowing it, she had just let me know that there was a game to be played. This time the game was a test. I didn't know anything about this test, but I planned to find out about it.</p>
<p>I went straight to a bookstore and found a book titled <em>The Brain Watchers</em> that had three chapters on the Minnesota Study of Values Test. I bought the book and read it that night so I'd be ready for the test the next day. The questions on the MSV Test have five multiple choice answers that you rank in their order of importance to you. The five categories of answers are Money, Politics, Aesthetics, Religion and Social Significance. For example, one question I remember was: &quot;When you look at Leonardo Da Vinci's painting The Last Supper, what do you feel? Rank the following in their order of importance, 1 being the most important and 5 being the least important.</p>
<p>The social implications of the event,<br>
The beauty of the painting,<br>
The value of the painting,<br>
The political impact of the painting,<br>
The religious ramifications of the painting.</p>
<p>Depending on what kind of job you are applying for, there is a right way and a wrong way to rank the answers. If you want to be a broker, the ranking for the question above is as follows: the highest ranking is the money answer, followed by the politics answer, social significance, aesthetics and finally the religion answer. If you want to go to work as a parish priest, every right first answer is the religion answer, then social and so on, and the money answer is always last. Once you know that's how their game is played, the test isn't hard. It's very simple. You can see very quickly which one of the five choices represents each of the categories; then you just rank them the way you believe the employer wants them ranked.</p>
<p>So the next day, I took the test and gave them 1,2,3,4,5 money, politics, social significance, aesthetics, religion on every question. I didn't even miss one on purpose to make it look good. That was a small mistake. I should have reversed 1 and 2 a couple of times but I didn't. My test was perfect -- absolutely no wrong answers. Now when they grade this test, it comes out on a scattergram chart. If you're meant to be a broker, your scattergram looks something like a butterfly. Well, mine came out a perfect butterfly. Fitzgerald didn't care, he was going to hire me unless I really blew the test. But he did say, &quot;You really did well on that test. I haven't seen anybody do that well before.&quot; I told him I had studied a little bit before I took the test. &quot;You're not really able to study for that test.&quot; &quot;Well, you are, and you aren't,&quot; I said. The next day I started working as Cohan's assistant.</p>
<p>It was 1968 and the stock market was booming. It was going straight up and everything was wonderful. Everyone in the office was making money. Then suddenly it stopped going up, and it started going down. When that happened, the only guy in the office making money was Ed Cohan. He was still doing business and everyone else was looking at their phones. I said to myself, &quot;Self, I think I'm going into futures. I like the idea that I'm not at the mercy of the market only going up; I like the idea of being able to make money when the market goes down, too.&quot; I don't care how good a stockbroker you are, if the market is going down you're in trouble. You've got to take a defensive posture and you're not going to do as much business.</p>
<p>I finished the MBA program in September 1969 and, as part of the deal I made with the brokerage firm, I was off to the three month broker training program in New York. I went to the Big Apple a month before the program started and spent that time in the futures division rubbing elbows with all the biggies. I wanted to know how they did what they did and why; what worked and what didn't work. I was on a fast track because I'd been working for Ed Cohan for a year, so everyone in the futures division in New York knew who I was. I was the one with the perfect butterfly chart.</p>
<p>Once again, I got the impression I was better than the others. I was &quot;more equal&quot; than the other trainees because I knew most of the people in the futures division, and I worked for Cohan. Once we got into the actual training program, I ended up teaching part of the commodity portion of the program. The regular instructors were from New York, and they sort of knew what to say as far as the tests were concerned. But they didn't really know futures, because the big futures exchanges were in Chicago. They quickly figured out that I did know what was going on, and they made me an assistant instructor. When they had questions on commodities, they would come to me. If I didn't know the answer, I knew I could get the answer from Cohan. Once again, I had the Midas touch and a hook.</p>
<p>Someone on the staff told somebody back in the futures division that I'd been a very big help teaching the class, and I got a call from Tom O'Hare, the firm's taxstraddle expert. He did huge production; $2 million or $3 million a year, all on referrals from stockbrokers. A broker would call and say, &quot;I've got a client who's made $2.5 million this year. Can you do a tax-trick?&quot; Tom would say, &quot;Yeah. How big a trick do you want? How much of that is he willing to risk to try to do it?&quot; Tom O'Hare was a master at it.</p>
<p>Well, Tom called me and wanted to see me in his office. When I got there, we exchanged pleasantries and then he pulled out my file. He said, &quot;I really wanted to meet the prima donna who actually had the gall to paint a perfect butterfly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry sir? I don't know what you're talking about.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, you do! Nobody could do a perfect butterfly unless he knew exactly what I'm talking about.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, I read a book--&quot;<br>
&quot;That book wouldn't be <em>The Brain Watchers</em> would it?&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, let me see, as I recall ... yes, I think that was the name of the book ... and it helped me a lot on the test.&quot;<br>
He said, &quot;Okay. How close do you think you would really have come to the butterfly if you hadn't read the book?&quot;<br>
&quot;To be honest, pretty close. If I hadn't known the game, I still wouldn't have been far off.&quot; (I wanted to be part of the country club set, remember? I already believed money was important.)<br>
&quot;Okay. This is what I do.&quot;</p>
<p>Then O'Hare proceeded to tell me about tax straddles. The entire firm sent him referrals who were willing to risk some capital to reduce their tax liability legally. O'Hare needed an assistant. &quot;I'm authorized to hire an assistant. I want someone who can learn what I do, understand what I do and help me do what I do. That way we can do a lot more business. I've looked at your test -- we both know that's B.S., but I give you credit for having done it. I've talked to your boss, Ed Cohan. He thinks you're a bright young man. I want you to come to work for me. I'll pay you $23,000 a year.&quot;</p>
<p>My alternative was to go back to Cincinnati as a broker under Cohan, basically as his assistant. But that wouldn't be bad. He was 52 years old and he had a client book that was massive. He wasn't going to be there forever, so whoever went to work for him was going to inherit the book and make a lot of money. Back in Cincinnati I was probably going to make $15,000 to $18,000 plus whatever I could produce by getting my own customers. (At that time a $100,000 producer would have netted about $25,000 --big money in 1968.) And this guy was offering me $23,000.</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Mr. O'Hare, I'm extremely flattered that you called me in to see you. I think working with you would be absolutely super. But as flattered as I am, I don't think I can take the job.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, immediately it became obvious that this was not the kind of guy who was told &quot;No&quot; very often -- particularly by some 24 year-old who didn't know where the washroom was.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean, you can't take the job?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it's that number. I really don't want to live in New York and neither does my wife. I could do it. I could open a travel agency in Kabul, Afghanistan if the numbers were right. I have a new bride who's pregnant with our first child, and she doesn't want to move to New York. We could deal with it. But there would have to be some compensation for dealing with it and, quite frankly, $23,000 doesn't do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean? What are you going to make in your first year in Cincinnati?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, all I have to do is $100,000 in gross production and I'll make at least $25,000. Plus, you know Larry Fitzgerald is going to give me a bonus if I do $100,000 my first year. I'll probably make 26 or 27 grand. So why would I want to come to New York for 23 grand when I know the odds are--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait a minute! You're.going to do a hundred grand your first year?&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, yeah, I think so.&quot;<br>
&quot;But aren't you going to be working for Cohan?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes sir, but he can't handle his book. His book is huge. I'll take what he can't get to. I think I can gross $150,000 out of his book in my spare time.&quot;<br>
&quot;Okay. I'll offer you $27,000.&quot;<br>
&quot;$30,000.&quot;<br>
&quot;Get out of my office.&quot;<br>
&quot;I went a little too far?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yep. You went a little too far. Get out of my office.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. O'Hare, it's been a pleasure. I hope you have considered it a pleasure. I'll talk to you in a year, and we'll see who was right. I won't forget; please don't you forget, because, honest to God, I am flattered that you invited me in here and offered me the job.&quot;</p>
<p>I did $162,000 my first year; one of the highest production figures a rookie at the firm ever did. I called O'Hare and said, &quot;I am LOS-2 (length of service, 2 years) as of today. Go over and check your little machine. You're going to find I did $162,000. I was right, and you knew I was right. Plus, Fitzgerald gave me a little kicker; I made 26.7% out of that $162,000. I made $43,000 in Cincinnati, which spends a lot better than $27,000 in New York. Would you like to re-open negotiations? I'm now $50,000 offer.&quot; He laughed and said, &quot;No. I've gotten someone who may not have the chutzpah you do, but he'll do just fine for $28,000.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="3-wood-that-i-would-trade">3 Wood That I Would Trade</h2>
<p>A year after I started working for Cohan the firm decided to start something called regional trade units. The home office told us that if we were going to be in this region and do futures business, we had to be in Cleveland. I believed them. That was a mistake. I should have stayed with Ed Cohan. Unfortunately, he didn't tell me that was possible until it was too late. Cohan was the proverbial 500 hundred pound canary; he could do whatever he wanted. If he had told the higher-ups that he wanted me to stay, I would have been able to stay. He was a great guy, but he wasn't aggressive. He didn't say, &quot;Hey Jim, you don't have to do that. You can stay and work with me,&quot; so I figured I had to move to Cleveland.</p>
<p>I was flattered to be invited to interview for a job in the regional trade unit, considering that I was a 24 year-old with only one year of experience. I was offered a position in Cleveland, and I took it. The deal was: all the stock brokers in the region would refer their futures business to two other futures brokers and me and take a split of the commissions. I moved to Cleveland in May 1970 and did a lot of business my first year, most of it in lumber. I developed a good client base and contacts in the lumber industry. One day our little group, which had grown to five from three, did more business in futures that all of the 112 stock brokers in the office did in securities, combined!</p>
<p>Between knowing Cohan, teaching in New York and producing some of the firm's best LOS-1 figures ever, I was pretty full of myself. I continued to believe that I was different and better than the run-of-the-mill broker. Believing I could bend or break the rules led me to do something really stupid -- not illegal, just a little ahead of its time and more than just a little against firm policy. One of my customers had a trading system, and he wanted to manage some outside money. He proposed that I raise $30,000 and put it into an account. He would trade the account, take no fees and split profits and losses fifty/fifty with the customers who had put up the money. This sort of arrangement is done all the time today and usually under terms much less advantageous for the customer. Today there are usually fees, and no money manager shares in the losses.</p>
<p>So I raised the money and informed the customers exactly what we were doing, and they signed papers agreeing to the terms. I even documented the arrangement with the state securities authorities by registering the account as a limited partnership. But I opened the account as an individual account, which it really wasn't.</p>
<p>Well, the guy made money for a while but then he started losing money. After he lost $20,000 of the customers' money, I started getting antsy and said, &quot;Okay, no big deal, but you need to put up your half of those losses: $10,000.&quot; He sent a check. The check bounced. Naturally, that caught the attention of the operations manager. The long and short of it is that the trader lost the original $30,000 and $20,000 more. He couldn't, or wouldn't, pay the $20,000 owed to the firm and I got fired. I was terminated &quot;for cause,&quot; which is a big no-no as far as the New York Stock Exchange is concerned. I got blackballed. I couldn't get a job anywhere. Soon after that the firm collected the money from the client, but a fat lot of good it did me by then.</p>
<p>So I called my friend Jack Salmon, who by then was the president of the regional brokerage firm he was working for when I met him back in college. I hadn't had a job for three months, and I really didn't want to go to work for a regional firm. But you gotta do what you gotta do. I still had a client base that I thought I could move. ''I'm sure I can move the lumber accounts. Do you know any firms where I could take my business?&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;Come to work for us,&quot; he said. &quot;My Cleveland office could really use your talents. I'll pay you 50% of gross. Plus I'll pay you a 5% override on the whole office.&quot; My previous employer had only paid me 25% of gross so this was a great deal if I could continue to do the business. Sometimes, knowing the right people and being in the right place at the right time can make all the difference in the world. I went to work for Salmon in a tiny four man office in Cleveland. Most of my accounts transferred over, so business was back to normal fairly quickly.</p>
<p>I made good money between January 1973 and July 1976. All the commodity markets got hot when Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971, and the grain markets went crazy in 1973 and 1974. My clients were making money and I was making money. I bought a house and a sports car. I went to the managers' meetings, and I was honored as the leading manager based on production improvement. Once again, I encountered the Midas touch syndrome; everything I touched turned to gold. I didn't think things could get any better than that, but they did.</p>
<h3 id="chicago">Chicago</h3>
<p>The only commodity exchange membership I had ever wanted was one that would enable me to trade lumber without having to pay for the right to trade all the other commodities which came with a full membership. In 1976 the Chicago Mercantile Exchange created exactly that kind of membership. Leo Melamed, Chairman of the CME at the time, came up with a brilliant gimmick to pay for the new Mere building by selling equity in the exchange without diluting the full memberships. He created a Non-Livestock-Membership (NLM) that permitted you to trade lumber and eggs. The NLM seat cost $20,000 compared to the going rate of $125,000 to $150,000 for a full membership at the CME or the Chicago Board of Trade.</p>
<p>I called Jack Salmon and said, &quot;This is it! I want to move to Chicago. There's really no one in the office here in Cleveland other than me anyway, so let's bag this thing and I'll move to Chicago.&quot; I bought the seat and moved to Chicago in June 1976.</p>
<p>I wanted to dress for success for my new job in Chicago. An old fraternity brother of mine, Jimmy Showalter, had a men's clothing store in Lexington, Kentucky. Jimmy's store had nice clothes: Hickey Freeman kind of stuff. Not Armani, but very nice. I called him and asked if I could come into his store on a Sunday when he was closed and deck myself out in a new wardrobe. &quot;Well what are we talking about here, Jim?&quot; he asked me. I could tell he didn't want to come in on a Sunday just for me. I said, &quot;I'm talking about spending some serious money on new clothes. Maybe $8,000 or $10,000 to have it done right.&quot; Suddenly, Sunday didn't sound too bad to Jimmy. So I flew to Lexington and got a new wardrobe.</p>
<p>When you buy a seat on the exchange, you get to select the call letters that will be engraved on your J.D. badge that other traders use to identify you when they trade with you in the pit. You want to stand out in the crowd so traders will trade with you often. Some people use their initials, nickname or some catchy combination of letters that makes them easy to remember. In my case, since I was always looking for whatever edge I could get, I picked the initials LUCK. I'd rather be lucky than good anyway. I thought by calling myself lucky maybe I'd be lucky, plus it was very easy to remember. Everybody knew who LUCK was. It was a badge that people could instantly identify with and remember.</p>
<h3 id="learning-the-trading-floor">Learning the Trading Floor</h3>
<p>Very quickly, it became obvious to me that the best trader in the lumber pit was a guy named Stu Gimble. He was head and shoulders above everybody. Just like at the country club when I wanted to ingratiate myself with the movers and shakers, I wanted to get to know Gimble. So, not knowing any better Gust like when I got my pledge pin), I walked up to him one day and said, &quot;Stu, can I take you to lunch?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't go to lunch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can I take you to dinner? Can I take you for a drink? Look, you can call it anything you want, I just want to go out and talk with you. You're the best trader in the pit so you're the man I gotta talk to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, we'll go to lunch.&quot;</p>
<p>Once again I set myself apart from the rest of the crowd by getting to be friends with Stu Gimble and another phenomenal trader on the floor, Joe Siegel. Joe moved around mostly in the pork bellies and the lumber pits. I learned a lot from the two of them. I still think Gimble was the best mechanical trader ever on the floor.</p>

<p>As part of this new Non-Livestock-Membership the Board of Governors of the CME decided to have two new governors from the NLM Group on the Board. There was a nominating committee to choose four people from the NLM Group to run for those two spots, and I was approached and asked if I'd be interested in running for the Board. I guess I looked gubernatorial wearing these fancy-schmancy clothes to the floor. The dress code for the floor was a tie and your trading jacket -- no jeans or tennis shoes. Everybody else was wearing khakis and corduroys and I was walking around in $600 vested suits. I'd have my trading jacket on over a vest and a $50 tie. I was well dressed for just about any business environment, but on the floor I was extremely well dressed. Once again, I thought I was a little different from, and a little better than, other people.</p>
<p>The idea of a contest for a Board of Governor's seat was flashing &quot;game&quot; to me. It was like freshman English, mind games in the military and the MSV test. I said, &quot;Sure, I'd love to be a candidate.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, what do you do when you're in high school and someone asks you to run for student council? You say, &quot;Sure.&quot; But then you don't run; you anti-run. Everything is done to deemphasize it because you don't want the embarrassment of trying and losing. So I said to myself, &quot;Self, whether you lose because you didn't run for the Board of Governors or whether you lose because you ran hard, it's the same outcome. So let's really run hard. Let's get aggressive and try to get elected. And if you don't get elected, you don't get elected. Big deal.&quot;</p>
<p>I did everything I could to get elected. I sent platform letters. I had Jack Salmon send letters. Then I sent hand-written letters asking for votes. Well, nobody else was really running. They were all doing the &quot;I don't want to run because I don't want to lose&quot; routine. If you run aggressively in that situation, you win by a landslide. I won 121 votes out of 150 votes.</p>
<p>I was elected to the Board of Governors of the CME after only six months in Chicago. I was 33 years old, looked like I was 25 and acted like I was 22, but I was on the Board of Governors. After the election, Leo Melamed came up to me and said that I would also represent the NLM on the Executive Committee of the Board of Governors since I had the most votes in the election. It turned out the Executive Committee was where everything really happened. Anytime you see a committee of more than ten, it isn't the real committee. There's a sub-committee somewhere making the decisions. So the Board at that time was eighteen members and the Executive committee was six. I couldn't believe I had just been elected to the Board of Governors, and I didn't even know the Executive Committee existed. But suddenly I was on it. I had only been in town six months, and I was elected because I had presence, wore a vest and $80 shoes, knew a lot about the markets and knew a lot of people in the industry.</p>
<p>Through a series of chance occurrences, I became a player in the cradle of the futures industry. All of a sudden I was in the inner circle. Fortunately, once I got there I wasn't bad at the game. I played by the rules and became very involved in the Exchange and the industry. It was a very heady experience to be an exchange official after such a short time in Chicago and to be friends with the two best traders on the floor after such a short time in the pit. I began to think of myself as one of the 'bigger players.&quot; I was going to the floor every day and while most of my trading was still focused on customer business, I was starting to trade more for my own account. I was probably making $200,000 to $300,000 a year and spending a lot of it. I can't even remember half the stuff I bought. I also made investments that I can't even remember. My ego was getting fed from all quarters: I was a Governor, a member of the Executive committee and friends with Gimble and Siegel. I was a little different. I was a little better than the rest of the crowd; just like getting my pledge pin in college and the multipromotion in the military. I remember one morning I was heading out the door on my way to work, and I stopped at the mirror in the hall tree to straighten my tie. I looked at myself, and I said, &quot;Goddamn. Life in the FAST lane.&quot; Life was great and I didn't think it could get any better. But it did.</p>

<p>There was another guy at my firm who was also involved in the lumber market. Larry Broderick had come from the cash lumber business and was working in our St. Louis office. Both of us were doing some business with Potlatch, a huge paper manufacturing and lumber firm in the northwest. The Potlatch family had been cutting wood since Noah's flood, and the guy who ran their trading operation was a guy named Tom Tomjack. One day Tomjack called me and said, &quot;This is stupid. We've got you doing your thing in Chicago and Broderick doing his thing from St. Louis. You guys ought to be working together. Why don't we all get together have lunch and talk about it?&quot;</p>
<p>When we met him on the west coast for lunch, he said, &quot;Look guys, together you two would make the best single broker in the business. Why don't you figure out a way to work together and stop being two independents.&quot; So we did. We became partners, and very shortly we started doing a lot of business because the arrangement really worked. Larry had fantastic connections in the cash market and I great floor information and execution services.</p>
<p>I was walking into the lumber pit every day with big orders. &quot;Buy 50 of this. Sell 100 of that.&quot; When you start doing size like that in the pit, it can really do to your head; the other people in the pit don't know whether the orders are for your account or for a client's. It also makes it very easy to start trading that kind of size for your own account. I was the biggest broker in the pit in terms of doing size orders. Larry and I had a large percentage share of the market. Lumber volume was something like 3,000 or 4,000 contracts a day and we were doing 600 or 800 contracts a day between client and personal trading. At 6'3&quot; with a booming voice and 100 lot orders, I became a presence in the pit.</p>
<p>So not only did I think I was neat, but a lot of other people did, too. I thought I was different and somehow better than other people; like I had some sort of Midas touch. I might have thought it was true, but it wasn't. Little did I know that all the times I thought I was good, I had only been lucky. For example, when I was sent to Korea and became an 5-3 as a 2nd Lieutenant was it because I was good or lucky? Lucky. Everyone else was sent to Vietnam so there was a personnel shortage in Korea. When I happened into that brokerage the day after Cohan's assistant quit, was it because I was good or lucky? Lucky. When I became a Board Governor and Executive Committee member after only six months in Chicago, was it because I was good or lucky? Lucky. The successes in my life had given me a false sense of omniscience and infallibility. The vast majority of the successes in my life were because I got lucky, not because I was particularly smart or better or different. I didn't know it at this point in the story, but I sure as hell was about to find out.</p>

<p>I will never forget the first day I made $5,000 trading. I felt exactly the same way I did the first day I made $5 caddying when I was ten years old. To make the five bucks, I caddied all day long. I made $5 for ten hours of carrying a golf bag. Fifty cents an hour. It was the greatest feeling in the world. Then there was the first day I made $10,000. Same feeling. Then the first day I made $20,000, and so on.</p>
<p>I remember one Thanksgiving I was at home in Kentucky with my folks and my brother. The Friday after Thanksgiving my brother and I flew to Chicago so he could see what I did for a living. I was long the lumber market and losing about $40,000 or $50,000 on this position when we arrived in Chicago. We went into the lumber pit and I explained how everything worked. Then to demonstrate how things worked, I bought 10 contracts. The market went down and I bought some more. After a little while the market turned and roared to the upside and I bought it all the way up. We walked out of the pit with $37,000 in an hour of trading. It was just one of those days when the market was going to go up because I was buying it. Some days you just can't do anything wrong. Including all the money my customers made that day plus all the commissions I generated, we made about $100,000. And it felt just the same as the first day I made $5 caddying.</p>
<p>In December 1980 Broderick and I were at the height of our business. We had accounts with everybody who was anybody in the lumber business, so we had a very impressive customer list and an equity run with over $3.5 million on it. We were approached by the new president of another regional firm. He was trying to turn it around and wanted us not only for our customer business, but also for my stature in the industry. If I went with his firm, he would gain some immediate credibility that he was turning this little firm around. So he made us a deal that was just crazy: 50% payout, expense accounts, super neat office, fancy furniture, built in bar. I literally told him at the time that there was no way he was going to make any money on the deal but he did it anyway. This was probably the zenith of my career. I was making plenty of money, I had good accounts and I was on the Executive Committee and Board of Governors. Life was great.</p>
<p>With interest rates skyrocketing in 1979 and 1980, the housing market, and consequently the lumber market, felt the pinch. The high interest rates depressed new homes sales, the main malrket for lumber. Lumber prices plunged and volume in the lumber pit dried up. It went from about 6,000 contracts a day down to 1,000. I don't care what your market share is; when the market shrinks by that amount, you've got problems. There was no longer enough business in lumber futures for me to maintain my lifestyle.</p>
<h3 id="the-arabian-horse-fiasco">The Arabian Horse Fiasco</h3>
<p>I figured I could apply my &quot;money making talents&quot; to other business ventures and maintain my lifestyle. &quot;I know what I'm doing. I'm smart and I have the net worth to prove it.&quot; One of the smartest guys I ever met was Jim Gleasman. He was also one of the craziest people I ever met. He had this knack of being the big picture guy. He was always coming up with grand schemes to make money. In one of his schemes, we were going to buy an island off the coast of South America. It cost something like $2 million. But we were going to leverage the purchase by putting down only $100,000 and borrowing the rest using the teakwood grown on the island as collateral. We were going to harvest the teakwood, sell it, make a fortune and then own the island for nothing. Gleasman was nuts -- he was constantly coming up with these ideas. Every week he'd have a new way to make a million dollars.</p>
<p>One day he started talking about Arabian horses.<br>
&quot;You buy these beautiful horses and you breed them and you show them in horse shows and you make a lot of money.&quot;<br>
&quot;Are you sure that's right?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>I never could get a handle on why or how you made a lot of money with these horses. These things don't do anything. They don't race or run the steeplechase -- nothing. They're show horses. You walk them around and somebody pays $2 million for this thing that walks around looking pretty. Sounded crazy to me, but Gleasman and I started looking at Arabian horses.</p>
<p>He came up to me one day and! said, &quot;I've got it. I found a couple who are getting divorced and they're selling everything they own in common to settle their divorce decree. They have an Arabian: horse we can buy for $22,000.&quot; This was the first number he'd mentioned that I could even think about paying for a horse that didn't do anything. So we went and saw this horse. His name was Onyx. Onyx was beautiful. Gorgeous. A dark gray Arabian. He had this pedigree and that pedigree, and so on. &quot;Okay, let's do it. Buy the horse. What's it gonna cost?&quot;</p>
<p>The minute you buy one of these things the cash register just starts running. We had to transport it over to the stables, pay for room and board, pay the vet and pay for training. After a few months, it wa$ getting to be kind of expensive. We had something like $20,000 each in Onyx.</p>
<p>Then one day I got a call from Gleasman.<br>
&quot;It's Onyx,&quot; he said.<br>
&quot;What do you mean, <em>it's Onyx</em>?&quot;<br>
&quot;They just checked Onyx into the emergency room of the Ohio State equine hospital.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ah, god. Now what?&quot;<br>
&quot;He's got a rare blood disease.&quot;</p>
<p>Naturally, we hadn't insured Onyx yet. We figured that after training him and documenting his pedigree, he was going to be worth more and we'd be able to insure him for a lot more. The S.O.B. ran through another thirty grand before he died. The Arabian horse fiasco cost me about $50,000 before it was over. Here I was thinking I could make money in Arabian horses, and I couldn't even ride one.</p>
<h3 id="soybean-oil-spreads">Soybean Oil Spreads</h3>
<p>I decided to stay away from horses and stick with the markets where at least I thought I understood what was going on. So, as the lumber market dried up, my business changed. I gradually moved my business away from the floor and started handling more speculative customer business from upstairs, trading from a quote machine and doing more general futures business instead of just lumber. I started opening some speculative accounts and getting my lumber accounts interested in trading other markets, too.</p>
<p>With this change in my business, I needed some help. I knew a lot about the lumber market, but not too much about other markets. An old friend of mine, Kirby Smith, had also joined this regional firm. This was the old &quot;pay someone who knows&quot; routine. I knew Kirby from my days at the other regional firm, and we had kept in touch. I had always been impressed with the depth and breadth of his knowledge of the markets. He just knew stuff that I didn't know. It was a classic case of &quot;anybody who knows more than I do must really be smart, because I know I'm pretty smart.&quot; Kirby was brilliant; he really knew what he was talking about in a lot of markets, particularly the grain market.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1982 Smith started focusing on the soybean market. The beans had been in a bear market since 1979. Kirby had this really big thing for soybean oil. (Soybean oil 1980. is made from crushing soybeans into oil and meal.) He was talking about how the supply of bean oil was getting tight, there would be a shortage and the price was going to go straight up. Now, all I knew about soybean oil was that it was used to make mayonnaise, and as far as I could see there were plenty of jars of Hellmann's on the shelf at the grocery store. But, as I said, Kirby was brilliant. He knew all there was to know about this market. Pretty soon I began to learn a lot about it too, and I started following the soybean market very closely.</p>
<p>In early 1983, we started building bull spread positions in bean oil. (We were bullish, so we were long the nearby month of soybean oil and short a deferred month. If there was a shortage and supplies got tight, the nearby month price would go up more than the deferred month and we would make money.) As always, when I started to believe in something I really believed. I called everybody I knew and told them &quot;our&quot; story about soybean oil and told them to get involved so they could make some money. If you even thought you knew my name, you had bean oil spreads on. I called everybody: my brother, traders, friends, customers. My secretary heard me tell the story on the phone so many times she even opened an account and put five spreads on for herself. The neat thing about these spreads was you didn't have to put up any initial margin. They were marked-to-the-market at the close of each day so you had to cover any paper loss, but it didn't require any money to open a position. That enabled us to build up big positions. And I mean big positions. So big, that one day the Chicago Board of Trade called to inform me I had exceeded the speculative position limit of 540 spreads. They made me sell out to the point where I was holding only 540 spreads. So not only did I have on 540 spreads, but there were another 700 spreads among all these other people to whom I had told &quot;our&quot; story.</p>
<h3 id="road-to-riches">Road to Riches</h3>
<p>That summer Pat and I had planned to do something we had never done: take a real family vacation. We were going to take the kids and travel the upper east coast. Things were going so well with business that before we left on the vacation, I went out and bought a brand new Porsche 911 convertible. Then I went and spent $11,000 to rent a forty-five foot motor home for the entire month of August.</p>
<p>The plan was to leave Chicago, go to Washington, D.C. to visit my brother Terry and then head up the east coast. I had a phone installed in the motor home so I could keep up with the markets from the road. We left Chicago the first thing in the morning Monday August 1, 1983. About lunchtime I called Smith from my mobile phone in the motor home.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey. What's the soybean market doing today?&quot;<br>
&quot;Beans are 20 cents higher.&quot;<br>
&quot;Great! Why are we up?&quot;<br>
&quot;A weather report calling for unseasonably hot, dry weather for at least the next ten days.&quot;</p>
<p>I loved it. While I was on vacation, the soybean crop was going to roast in the worst drought since the Dust Bowl days of 1936-37. I was going to get paid by the market to be on vacation. I thought to myself, &quot;Maybe we'll go all over the country next year and I'll just trade from on the road.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's the lumber market doing?&quot;<br>
&quot;It's limit down.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ouch.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, I was up more in the bean oil that I was down in the lumber so I was still up on the day.</p>
<p>We pulled into my brother's on Wednesday, August 3rd. The next night some of Terry's friends came over for dinner. They had just seen a new movie about the commodities markets called Trading Places and they wanted to know all about the commodities markets and the life of a trader. So I stayed up half the night telling them war stories about my experiences in the markets. When they found out about the lumber position I had on that was just killing me, they couldn't believe I could have such a loss and handle it. I also told them about the killing I was making in the soybean oil market. They were all caught up in the conversation because of the movie they had just seen.</p>
<p>The next day lumber was limit down. So I called Smith. &quot;See if you can call somebody and find out why lumber is down so much.&quot; He came back with a story that some huge commodities fund was liquidating a large position to keep from taking delivery of lumber. &quot;Well, okay,&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;that's no big deal. The market will start back up after this clown gets out of the market.&quot; But the market continued limit down for three days. Limit down for three days on 50 or 60 contracts adds up to real money. I was down about $70,000. Finally, I started asking Smith some intelligent questions like: &quot;What are the spreads doing? Where is the cash market trading? What is plywood doing?&quot; The bull spreads had been deteriorating for about eight days or so, but that day they were starting to turn back around. &quot;Okay. Buy twenty contracts at the market.&quot; With the market turning, I figured I would add on to the position so I could make back the money more quickly. Then we left Terry's and continued the vacation.</p>
<p>Well, it turned out the day I bought those last 20 contracts was the low in the market for a while and the market rallied $13.50 per thousand board feet in about a week. Somewhere around Philadelphia I had gotten about $50,000 of the $70,000 back. &quot;Victory, out of the jaws of defeat,&quot; I thought to myself. I was driving down the Jersey Turnpike, drinking Budweiser, talking on the phone, trading commodities and thinking I was the neatest guy in the world.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the lumber position didn't force any change in the real position-- soybean oil. I'd call Smith a couple of times a day to see how the bean oil market was doing.</p>
<p>&quot;How's it look?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, it looks great!&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, I thought so.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, we're fine.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, I wish we could buy some more.&quot;</p>
<p>We would go back and forth like this with the old &quot;buddy&quot; routine, preaching to the converted. There's nothing worse than two people who have on the same position talking to each other about the position.</p>
<p>&quot;How's it look?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, it looks great. Beans are limit up and so is bean oil. This thing is bullish as hell.&quot;<br>
&quot;Are they still focusing on the weather?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, and also that Fed Chairman Volker and Treasury Secretary Regan have launched a coordinated intervention in the currency markets with European central banks to push down the value of the U.S. dollar.&quot;<br>
&quot;That'll help our exports and push grain prices up even more, won't it?&quot;<br>
&quot;That's right.&quot;</p>
<p>After the close on August 11th, the Agriculture Department released a crop report indicating damage to the crop as of an August 1st survey. The market had been up strong for several days going into the report. I called Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;How's the market?&quot;<br>
&quot;Limit down and our bull spreads in bean oil are losing some ground.&quot;<br>
&quot;Limit down? Why? I thought the report was bullish, didn't you?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, but hurricane Alicia has moved into the Gulf of Mexico and the market thinks the rains from the storm will help the crop in the Mississippi Delta.&quot;<br>
&quot;That's the stupidest thing I ever heard. Alicia isn't going to spawn gentle spring showers. Those storms are going to be so violent they'll probably rip the soybeans right out of the ground. I think the market should be up.&quot;</p>
<p>The market was limit down again the next day and the bull spreads in oil lost some more ground. One of the oldest rules of trading is: if a market is hit with very bullish news and instead of going up the market goes down, get out if you're long. An unexpected and opposite reaction means there is something seriously wrong with the position. Two consecutive limit down days following the release of a supposedly bullish government report does not indicate a strong market. Faced with that situation, what did these two bold and committed traders do? Get out or confidently hold onto their position and opinion? That's right! We decided the market was wrong, and we were not going to let them get us out of this great position. Within days the market turned and was moving our way again. Break the rules, maintain your conviction and reap the rewards. Our courage under fire was about to be rewarded.</p>
<p>The evening of Wednesday, August 24th we pulled into Larry Broderick's lake house just outside of Cleveland. We were wrapping up the vacation and I wanted to be back in the office the following Monday. Larry and I got up the next morning, went into his office in the house, made some phone calls, watched the markets a little bit and then went out onto the dock. At the end of the dock he had a quote machine, a phone and a little refrigerator. We were sitting out in the sun on the last Thursday in August 1983, watching our market positions, drinking a beer and thinking life couldn't get any better. But it did.</p>
<p>Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of that week the bean oil market had closed limit up so the spreads hadn't made or lost any money for us. But on Thursday the spreads started to trade. The September bean oil that we were long went up 150 points, and the January month that we were short went up only 80 points. The contracts further out closed lower on the day. The bull spreads were working like a charm. At the end of the day, I had made $248,000. In one day -- a quarter of a million dollars!</p>
<p>Now, remember that all the people I knew in the whole world had these bean oil spreads on. My secretary made $2,400 that day. (That's real money when you're making $35,000 a year.) Broderick made almost $50,000. Including all the people I had told about this bean oil trade we were up almost $700,000 in one day. I was getting calls from all over the country telling me how great this was and how smart I was. And I agreed, &quot;Yes, I am so smart. But this is just the beginning. This bean oil market has a long way to go, and we are all going to get rich.&quot;</p>
<p>I also heard through our contacts in the market (since now we were pretty big players in the bean oil market) that it looked like the primary guy on the other side of this trade from us was none other than the legendary trader, Richard Dennis. (Richard Dennis, dubbed &quot;The Prince of the Pit,&quot; borrowed $1,600 from his family in 1970, bought a seat at the minor league Mid-America commodity exchange for $1,200 and ran the remaining $400 into a reported $200,000,000 over the next 15 years.) &quot;Ohhhh,&quot; I said. &quot;That's good news. We're gonna take out Richard Dennis. We'll go down in trading history as the guys who took out Rich Dennis. Can you stand it?&quot; Not only were we going to be rich, we were going to be famous, too.</p>
<h3 id="the-death-knell-phone-call">The Death Knell Phone Call</h3>
<p>The high from &quot;being right&quot; the market and making all that money is unbelievable. It cannot be duplicated with drugs. You are totally invincible. You are impervious to all pain. There's nothing bad in the world. It's literally like you expect God to call any minute and ask, &quot;Is it okay if I let the sun come up tomorrow morning?&quot; And after thinking about it for a minute you'll probably say, &quot;Yeah, go ahead.&quot; I called Smith and we mutually congratulated each other on our wisdom and knowledge, and for all the money we were now going to make -- not the money we had made, but the money we were going to make. We immediately accepted the money we had made and assumed that it was in our bank accounts. It was ours. We weren't even saying, &quot;Isn't it neat that we made an unconscionable amount of money today?&quot; That was a given. We were talking about all the money we were going to make. That day simply confirmed that we were right. I'll never forget going into Larry's house that afternoon and picking up a copy of the <em>The Robb Report</em>. Originally a magazine that listed used Rolls Royces for sale, it grew into the magazine to list ridiculously expensive things for sale: real estate for $5,000,000 and up, hunting lodges, estates, whole islands for sale. Everything in this magazine was the most expensive of its kind. If it were selling pens, they'd be priced at $500 each.</p>
<p>There was a section on motor homes and the Rolls Royce of motor homes was a thing called a Blue Bird Wanderlodge. I was sitting in the house, looking through The Robb Report and honestly thinking about buying a $400,000 motor home. Why would anyone spend a half a million dollars for a bus? You'd have to be nuts. I was nuts! I was really thinking about buying this bus.</p>
<p>Friday morning I got up, went straight to the quote machine and sat on the edge of my seat moments before the market opened saying, &quot;Come on guys, open this sucker. Let's get going. I want to make some more money.&quot; I literally assumed ,I was going to make more money. The question was not whether I was going to make money. The question was how much money was I going to make. There was a total presumption of success; what had gone before would continue.</p>
<p>The market opened and the spreads corrected about 10 points or so from the previous day's huge rally. But that was $30,000 on my position! &quot;No big deal,&quot; I thought to myself. (Here's another sign of having lost control. Here's someone who has lost $30,000 and is saying, &quot;Hmmm. That's not so bad.&quot; That's a little nuts. Right? I'd just lost $30,000 in the first 5 minutes of Friday and I was feeling fine. &quot;No problem. Too bad we can't buy more of these.&quot;)</p>
<p>The market came back during the day from down 10 to up 30 points, and did it right on the close. Bang! The spreads went our way again. Perfect! You couldn't have written the script any better. Now we had Richard Dennis trapped over the weekend -- or at least we thought we did. We actually had the chutzpah to think it was &quot;good news&quot; that wonder-trader Richard Dennis was on the other side of our position.</p>
<p>I made $60,000 that day. But the best part of it was that the market moved perfectly. In the last 5 minutes of trading the front month rallied sharply. I made $60,000, which meant another $150,000 or so was made by the group. The clients were calling again, &quot;Ah, God, this is wonderful. You guys are so smart.&quot; Naturally, I agreed with them.</p>
<p>On Saturday my family and I drove back to Chicago. When I returned the motor home, I just turned it in and paid them another $500 or $1,000, whatever it was, to take care of the phone, etc. I just didn't want to bother with stuff. I was above all of that. My attitude was: &quot;How much money does it take to make whatever I want to happen, happen? Fine. Do it. Here's the money.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="soybean-oil-gets-slippery">Soybean Oil Gets Slippery</h3>
<p>Monday morning I got in my brand new Porsche 911 convertible, put the top down and took the outer drive by Lake Michigan to downtown Chicago. I got into the office at about 7:30, a full two hours before the bean market opened. The sofa and chair in my office were covered in some special leather from West Germany. I think the set cost $7,000. The stereo was a $4,000 Bang and Olufsen. Everything in this office was about the most expensive you could make it. It was like The Robb Report: &quot;How much can you spend on a desk? Fine. I'll buy it.&quot; I had a special desk that was on a copper pedestal coming out from the floor and the carpeting covered the base of it. On top of the pedestal was a giant 3' x 6' x 7&quot; piece of mahogany. The tabletop looked like it was suspended in mid-air. The credenza didn't touch the floor either. It was a matching piece of wood bolted to the wall, also looking like it was suspended. When you walked into the office all you could see was carpet stretching out in front of you, a copper column rising up from the carpet and two pieces of wood levitating in mid-air, defying gravity. And that is just what I thought I was doing: defying gravity. I sat down at my fancy desk on the edge of my chair waiting for the market to open, ready to have another $50,000 day and thinking life couldn't get any better than this. This time, I was right. It didn't.</p>
<p>When the bean oil market opened that Monday morning, the spreads opened a little against us. By the close of trading, the bean oil spreads had given back most of the gains of the previous two days because of rain in the soybean belt over the weekend. I figured it was no big deal since the market had been up so much in recent weeks. &quot;It's just a correction in a continuing bull market,&quot; I told myself. &quot;Besides, it is too late in the growing season for rain to do the crop any good.&quot;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, August 31st the oil spreads got smashed again, despite the fact that soybeans were 25 cents higher on rumors the Soviets were negotiating agreements to buy soybeans from the U.S. I was sure that with the beans up so much and the Soviet news, it was just a matter of time before the oil market caught up.</p>
<p>On Thursday the whole soybean complex (beans, meal and oil) collapsed on reports a Soviet jet fighter shot down a Korean Air Lines passenger plane.</p>
<p>&quot;What does the KAL downing have to do with the bean market?&quot; I asked.<br>
&quot;They think we'll impose a grain embargo against the Soviets just like Carter did when the Russians invaded Afghanistan in 1980,&quot; said Smith.<br>
&quot;That's stupid. The Russians didn't invade Korea. They accidentally shot down a passenger plane. There's no comparison. The market's wrong; we're not going to have a grain embargo.&quot;</p>
<p>I was right. Over the Labor Day weekend President Reagan condemned the Soviet assault but shunned tough retaliation. He refused to disrupt a new grain sales accord. Soybeans rallied sharply on the news, but the bull spreads in the oil market went down again. Once again, I chalked it up to the fact that the oil market had out-performed the beans in August; the beans were playing catch up and the oil market was resting before the next leg up. The spreads did stabilize for a couple of days as the market began to focus on the September 12th release of the Agriculture Department's crop report. That report turned out to be wildly bullish: the damage to the crop was more severe than previously thought. Beans opened almost limit up the next day, but closed almost limit down. However, the bull spreads in oil closed higher on the day.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; I said to myself, &quot;this oil market is starting to
turn back to the upside. This whole bull market was
driven by the oil market and bean oil is starting to rally
again. This market is turning.&quot; But the next day the oil
market collapsed again. Limit down in all contract months
and more than limit down in the spot month, since there
were no limits on the spot month.
On Friday the market stabilized and managed to
erase about a third of the week's losses. On. Monday,
September 19th the bean market and the oil market roared
to the upside. Over the weekend a winter storm system in
Canada exploded and was drifting toward the Midwest
U.S. &quot;This is great,&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;just a few weeks
after the worst drought since the 1930s wreaked havoc
with most of the soybean crop, an early frost threatens to
damage what remains. Okay, finally the market is going to
turn. This frost is going to revive the bull market.&quot; But it
wasn't to be. The market just slipped right back down
again. I never saw the spread trade better than it had on
that last Friday in August when I was at Broderick's lake
house. The decline was relentless, with only occasional
spasms to the upside: up $10,000 one day, down $25,000
the next.
The market continued to grind lower, and I
proceeded to lose about $20,000 to $25,000 a day, every
day, for months. The clients I advised were sophisticated
and experienced traders in their own right, and they had
been bailing out of the market since early September. As
far as I was concerned, this demonstrated their lack of
courage to buy with pride and hold with conviction.
Naturally, I didn't get out. I was in for the long pull. This
was going to be The Big Trade. The world was going to
run out of bean oil, maybe even mayonnaise, and Smith
and I were going to make $10 million.</p>
<h3 id="vertigo">Vertigo</h3>
<p>For the next several weeks Smith and I kept telling each
other, &quot;It's going to be all right. It's gonna turn.&quot; Every
news story we heard about the market we made fit the &quot;we
are going to be okay&quot; scenario. &quot;Now we know why the
market was down today. Now that we understand that, it's
going to go away. We're going to be okay.&quot; We
rationalized everything. It was like living in Tortilla Flat
with Danny and his friends, rationalizing everything.
&quot;Yeah, we just heard that some big commercial firm has
just taken some deliveries of bean oil, so if he's stopping
them then it must be okay now.&quot;
By the beginning of October, I was under water.
Soybean prices had fallen to the lowest levels in two
months -- since the August 11th Agriculture Department's
crop report predicting a curtailed harvest. Bean oil was
now at 29 cents, down from the September highs of 37
cents. I'd lost most of my money. As the position got
increasingly worse, I began to get margin calls. I'd be on
margin call for two or three days at a time but the firm's
attitude was: &quot;We know you're a big wheel. We know
you're on the Executive Committee at the CME, and we
know you're neat and you've got this fancy car. We know
you're good for the money.&quot; I'd wait a few days to see if
the market rallied. If it did, fine -- I wouldn't have to meet
the margin call. If it didn't, I'd spend the next couple of
days trying to borrow money from my friends so I could
meet the margin call.
I gradually began to lose my outward cool. I was
fighting with Pat and the kids; they had no idea what was
happening. But it's not uncommon for the spouses and
families of traders not to know what's going on with the
trader's market positions. I was skipping dinner so I
wouldn't have to face my family. I lost 15 pounds. I
couldn't sleep. I was going to bed every night knowing I
had to get up the next day and go watch this thing again. It
was horrible. It would be a Friday, and I'd say, &quot;Okay, it's
Friday. I can't lose any more on this for another couple of
days because the market won't be open.&quot; Weekends were
welcomed. It was exactly opposite of when I was making
money on that trade. When I was making money, I
couldn't wait for the market to open. When I was losing
money, I couldn't wait for it to close. Time is very painful
when you're losing money. All I wanted was for the
market to rally back to the August highs, and I'd get out.
We refused to accept the obvious: that we were going
under. We were holding each other's hands, and every day
we went through this little drill of losing an average of
$20,000 to $25,000 but telling ourselves that it was going to
be all right. Naturally, it never was. It got to be
excruciatingly painful. But I couldn't get out of the market
because as long as I had the position on, there was always
the belief, the chance, the hope, that I could make back the
money. If I got out of the market there wouldn't be any
chance anymore. &quot;Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of
my life. It's going to turn -- tomorrow.&quot; It was always
going to turn &quot;tomorrow.&quot; But it never did.
By the first week in November, I was under water big
time: $200,000 or $300,000. Bean oil was at 25 cents. So
from the high of August, I was down about $700,000 or
$800,000. What was worse is that I'd borrowed money
from my friends to the tune of about $400,000. I got
another margin call in mid-November, but I didn't want to
borrow any more money from my friends. So I decided to
ride out the storm again to see if the market would rally
enough to take me off the margin call. On November 17th
one of the senior managers from the brokerage firm came
into my office and started liquidating my position. The
firm finally, and mercifully, pulled the plug on me because
I couldn't do it myself.
They not only liquidated the account, but they also
started seizing whatever assets I had. They took my
membership and sold it, which forced me to resign from
the Board of Governors and the Executive Committee
since you can't be on the Board if you're not a member of
the Exchange. Then they literally started to take the stuff
out of the office: the furniture, the stereo and the levitating
desk and credenza. I can remember sitting at my desk
crying as they started to strip the office. It was the absolute
lowest point in my life. I had gone from having everything
on August 31st to nothing on November 17th. I couldn't
stand to watch them take all the stuff away, so I took the
pictures of my family off the wall, put them in a box and
walked out of the office. I vaguely remember wandering
the halls of the Exchange for a while trying to figure out
what I was going to do. I couldn't borrow any more money
from friends, and my only hope for making money had
been the bean oil position. Now it was gone. Well, Pat and
I had been through some tough times before, surely we'd
make it through this one, too. &quot;Oh my God! Pat! How was
I going to tell Pat what had happened? How was I going
to tell her that my fifteen year career and all of the money
had evaporated in the last two-and-a-half months?&quot; I
headed for The River Club at the Exchange to sort things
out over a Jack Daniels.
Several hours, and several drinks, later I weaved my
way to the Porsche. I remember deciding the only way I
could ever get out of this for my family was to kill myself.
I had about a million dollars worth of life insurance, and
the only way I could make it right for my wife and kids
was to hit a bridge at 100 m.p.h. I remember thinking to
myself, &quot;Everybody knows I drink too much anyway, so it
will look like an accident.&quot; I thought the insurance
company wouldn't pay if it was suicide. I got on the
Kennedy Expressway and started looking for a bridge. I
had barely even gotten out of the city when I noticed blue
lights flashing in my rear view mirror. I pulled over and
waited for the cop to come to the window.
&quot;License and registration, please. Any idea how fast
you were going, Mr. Paul?&quot;
&quot;Uh, ... 75? 85?&quot;
&quot;Try 18.&quot;
I couldn't believe it. I was so drunk and so dazed over
what had happened that I hadn't even gotten out of first
gear. I didn't get a speeding ticket. I got a non-speeding
ticket; a ticket for careless driving. I was a road hazard
because I was doing 18 m.p.h. on an expressway in a
Porsche.
After recovering from the temporary bout of insanity
of flirting with suicide, I spent the next three weeks in the
house. I re-finished the living room floor and did a bunch
of other little piddly things around the house. I had to act
like I was doing something constructive, so I became Mr.
Handyman. That was my &quot;job.&quot; I'd have the T.V. on the
financial news channel like I was watching the market and
staying abreast of things -- even though I didn't have two
dimes to put together to do anything about it. I even kept
my charts updated but it was all phony. I wasn't doing
anything; I was just acting like I was doing something.</p>
<h3 id="nadir">Nadir</h3>
<p>After about a month I went to see my old friend from the
lumber pit, Stu Gimble. I had no job, no money and no
prospect for either. For some reason Stu wasn't
discouraged at all. He thought it was the best thing that
could have happened to me. &quot;This is great. We'll get you
back on your feet again. All the great traders have gone
bust at least once in their careers. You're gonna be fine.&quot;
He leased and paid the rent on a seat in the Eurodollar pit
for me while he tried to teach me to do what he did. A
sudden realization was beginning to set in; I wasn't a
trader. I couldn't do it. I wasn't good enough.
I literally couldn't do what he did, even though I had the
best teacher and conceptually understood what he was
doing. I wasn't quick enough. He had this fantastic thing
for numbers that was unbelievable. But my brain didn't
work like his. So there I was in the Eurodollar pit, with no
customer business, trying to be a trader and I couldn't
make a living.
In September 1984, my accountant figured out that I
could re-file my previous three years' tax returns, average
all three years' income and get a tax refund. Combining
the losses of 1983 with the money I had made in '82 and
'81, I got a check from Uncle Sam for about $100,000. That
wasn't much money relative to my dire financial situation,
but it was a grub stake. The Eurodollar market was so
slow and efficient that there just wasn't much price
movement. I was used to the lumber market which really
moved a lot, and I thought that whatever I had learned in
the lumber pit would apply better to S&amp;Ps than
Eurodollars. I bought an IOM (Index and Option Market)
seat for $55,000. I was going to try to trade the S&amp;P 500
futures index.
I tried that for 5 months, and I didn't make any
money doing that either. I wasn't any good at it. Once
again, this validated that I didn't know how to trade. I
tried to rationalize that away, i.e., I hadn't traded in the pit
for so long, and I was used to trading from a computer
screen in an upstairs office. I sold the seat for $60,000, and
that was the last $60,000 I had in the whole world. I
hooked back up with Kirby Smith, who was at a small
brokerage firm, and we sat in an office everyday acting
like we were going to trade and make the money back.
I played that game until October 1985 and slowly ate up
the money. I was still paying for the car, the house and all
the expenses of having a family. You can go through
money pretty quickly with those kinds of bills and no
money coming in at all.
If I didn't get it together soon, I'd have to get a real
job. I'd have to go back to work to survive and keep my
family alive. I didn't want to do it, since I had come to
believe I was above all that. You gotta do what you gotta
do. However, I didn't intend to give up on trading. I
viewed it like blackjack in the caddy pen; I wasn't going to
quit playing, but I was going to quit losing. It was time to
be a smart man -- humbled, but resolved to learn from my
mistakes.</p>
