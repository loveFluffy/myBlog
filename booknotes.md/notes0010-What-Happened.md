# What Happened

## 希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Rodham Clinton)

>If you are tired, keep going.  
>If you are scared, keep going.  
>If you are hungry, keep going.  
>If you want to taste freedom, keep going.  
>--Harriet Tubman  

### Author's Note

I started this book with some words attributed to one of those pathbreakers, Harriet Tubman. Twenty years ago, I watched a group of children perform a play about her life at her former homestead in Auburn, New York. They were so excited about this courageous, determined woman who led slaves to freedom against all odds. Despite everything she faced, she never lost her faith in a simple but powerful motto: Keep going. That’s what we have to do now, too.

In 2016, the U.S. government announced that Harriet Tubman will become the face of the $20 bill. If you need proof that America can still get it right, there it is.
