    <h1>Article#0007: Incredible Dreams</h1>
    <p>
        My mom has difficult in falling asleep all year round. Even she is very tired after work, dreaming keeps torturing her, not all nightmares, but always give a terrible headache every morning. She told that feels like she just surivived a war every morning, exhausted. When I was a kid, I didn't realize how painful that might be. Then gradually I grew older, I got the same problem, but thankfully that is infrequent. Thinking back, all the incredible dreams she told then was one of the few sources of my bedtime stories.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here I'll write my own incredible dreams. As time pass by, all dreams will finally fade if I don't make notes. So I decide to write them down or even paint if I have to.
